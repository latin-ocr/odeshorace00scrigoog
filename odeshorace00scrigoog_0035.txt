From sire and Salamis when Teucer ssed,

He yet -as poeto sing-adorn’d his head,
Molsten'd by Bacchus, with the poplar leaf ;

Thon thus his sorrowing friends address’d in 'grief ;

“ Where fortune —kinder thau a parent-tendo,
There will we go, my comedes and my‘friends ;
Despair not :— Teucer leuda, und Teucer’s Fates ;
A foreign shore -the Delphiau truth relatos—
Shall prove of Salamis the ambiguous sound:

Oh Ξ oft with me in darker misery found,

Todoy your sorrows in the goblet steep,
'lo-morrow’s daun shall hail the boundless deep !” ¹
