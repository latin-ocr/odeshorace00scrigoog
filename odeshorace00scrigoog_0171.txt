Tbee, TelephUS, with thy thick h'air brighg.
-Like vesper clear, in early night-

Ripe Chlo& seeks 3 — me the desire

of Glycera burne with lingering fire.

ODE xx
TO PYRRHUS·

Dosae thou not all the peri} feel

From Libyan lion her whelps to steal? ’
Soon, Pyrrhus, soon, in timid flight,

The ravisher shall shun the fight3

When, through opposing rival bands,
Her fair Nearchus she demands ς
A contest, if the fight confer

The lovely prize on thee or her;
