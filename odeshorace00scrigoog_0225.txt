ODE XII.

TO vaIL.

Comus of spring, the gentle Threeian galee,
-Calming the wavesn impel the ewelling suils3
The frost deserte the plain 3-and now nemore

With winter’s snow the swellen terrente roar.

Now builds her nest the lone-unhappy bird,
Whose wailing note is still for Itys heard 3
still the disgraee of Cecrops’ house she sings,

The wicked vengeanee 011 the lust of kinge

The shepherds now, upon the tender grass,

-,- With pipe and song- the joyous season pass,
Pleasing the god, whom gentle floeks delight,
Who loves the shadows of the Arcadian height.
