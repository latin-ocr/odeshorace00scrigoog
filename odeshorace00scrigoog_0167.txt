ODE XVIL

ro nnius namn. '

AEnms, whose honour’d line and name
-- Ennobled - from old Lamus carne3
From whom the ancient Lamian rane
Descent, through faithful recorda, tracel

From him thy birth whom legend calls

Princo of the ancient Formian walls;
Far ruling o’er Marica's coast,

Where Liris' flowing waves are lost.

Unless the raven croaks in vain,
-The ancient prophetans of rain -
Our woods and coast to-morrow's storin

With leaves, and sea-weed shall deform.
