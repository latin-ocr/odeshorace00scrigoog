ODES

Thee first the tuneful Lesbian bore,

Who-fierce in war-’mid battles’ νοω,

Or when in port-the tempest past-
His shatter'd bark was anchor'd fast,

The Muses sang, the goblet's joy, .
And Venus with attendant b0y3

Or Lycus, for whose jet·black eyes
And sabl'e looks the fair-one sighs.

Apollo's pride l—melodious 5116111-
At heavenly banquets lov’d so well!
Thou solaco of our toil and pain,
Auenti, when I invoke thy strain.
