ODES

Bids me no more of Scythians write,
Or Parthian horseman’s daring ssight:

Since nothing may adom my sanga

But what to her, and Love belongs.

Here, slaves, live turs - unsparing-fiing‚
Hera frankineense, and vervain bring,
-The two-year caskt-a viatim slain,

My Glycera may be kind again 1

ODE XX.

TO MAECENAS.

In moderate caps, alone afford,
In Greeian barrel stor’d away,

Dear night, MaeeenaS, on tha day

 

Vna Sabine can my humble hasard,
