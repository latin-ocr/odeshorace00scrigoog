ona vn. 01¹ Holmon. 15

Some tune the untiring stn'ng, through endless

hours,
To spotless Pallae, and her favourite towers3
Entwining still the olive's graceful bough3
— Minerva’s chaplet, for her votary's brow 1-
While many a hard in J uno's praise has told
‘of Argos' horsea, and Mycenae's gold.
For me, nor Laoedaemon’s patient toil,
Nor yet Larissa’s soft„ luxuriant soil,
Equals the Albunean villa's echoing mund,
Bold Anio’s rush - with Tibur's groves around-
And--bath’d by wandering streame-the orehard
ground.

As the pure south, when storms tempestuous lower,
Clears 'the daaek sky, nor pours the ceaseless shower3
So, Planum, wisely cheer thy sadden’d soul,

Life’s voils dispelling with the generous bowl ; Ι

Whether ’mid campS‚ where glittering banners play,

Or your own Tibur’s shadowy groves you stray.
