oon xxvn. ΟΕ ΗΟΒΑΟΕ.

Pimplean muse, whom founts delight‚
Approach where sunniest flowers invite ;
Twine me a wreath for Lamia's brow:
Vain - without thee - my praises flow !
My Lamia’s honour'd name to sing --
To consecrate on Lesbian string -

May well thy newest lays inspiro,

Thine - with thy tuneful sister-cheir.

ODE XXVII.

ΤΟ HIS COMPANIONS.

Yomz joy-begot goblets with strife to deface -
So form’d for delight - is the eustom of Thrace;
Away with such barbarous usage, away!

And protect modest Bacchus from sanguine affray.

The sword of the Medes— only fitted for campe -·

How immensely discorda'nt with liquor and lamps!
