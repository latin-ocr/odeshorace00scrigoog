om: nx. OF HORACE. 31

Cease thy dread cymbala, and thy Phrygiam horn,
Which pride -with empty head too lofty borne —
And blind sels-love pursue, andFaith-like glaes-
Displeyingeseerets to the crowds that pase.

ΤΟ GLYCERA.

ΤΗΕ mother and the queen of love,
And Semele's Lyaean boy,
With lawless licence, bid me prove

Once more the long-forgotten joy.
I burn for Glycera still-who shines

Brighter than Parian marble-minee

I burn to view the seuey grace,

The dazzling lustre of her fece.

Venus deserte her Cyprian bowers, .
Invading me with all her powers ;
