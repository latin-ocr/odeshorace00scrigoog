oon xx1v. OF HORACE. 157

Not thino with flocks of slaughteffd sheep
The favour of the gods to keep,
Crowning their little sculptur’d brows

With rosemary, and myrtle-boughs:

Has guiltless hand the altar press'd?

Not vietim's brow - with fillets dress’d -

Shall easier Heaven’s compassion wake
Than craekh'ng salt, and holy cake.

ODE XXIV.

ΤΟ THE COVETOUS MAN.

Tuomn wealtbier than the unrifled store
Of Araby‚ or the Indian shore ;

Th0ugh Tuscan‚ or Apulian tide

Thy deeply-laid foundations hide ς
