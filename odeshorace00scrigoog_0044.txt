ἱ one xn. OF HORACE.

Camillus, of immortal seme,
And Ouriue nith neglected heir,
-Rome’s honour’d heroes i-seuntiest fure,
In oottnge on paternul soil,
Fitted for werfere’s noblest toil.
ι Andes the tree - unnoted - grows,

As burste - unseen - the opening rose

E’en so Mareellus' glories nise,

And- sudden -tnwer into the skies:
While high the Julian star aspires,

- A moon among the lesser fines! —

Thou guardian Sine of earth und heaven,

' , Saturnian Jove! -to whom is given

The care of mighty Caeser’s throne,

Be still his glory next thy own ;

Whether triumphent 0'en the host

of Parthiam, threatening Latium’s coast,

Or Seren, or the Indiens fur

He quells - subdu’d in Eustern wer ! -
