ODE 111.

ro Qnmrns nnnnms.

Cnnn end unruffied be thy mind

When fortune frowns 3- in sensons kind,

From joy's intemperate raptures fiy,
My Dellius, doom'd-like all-to die.

. Whether you live, to grief a prey,

Or, on the festel holiday,

Blest in some distant mend recline,
Queffing the 'old Falernian wine3

Where lofty pine, and poplar white,

- In socinl shade -their boughs unite,
And crystal streame, with slanting force,
Struggle along their trembling course. Ι

Bring perfumes-wine-and, oh! too brief!

The odorous rose-flower’s grateful leaf 3
