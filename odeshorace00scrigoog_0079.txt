Theo the poor swain for smiling plenty oroves3

Thoe, haughty mistress of the briny woves,
The seilor seeks, whose light Bithynion prow
The wild Carpathion wave is doom'd to plough.

fer-—
Cities and notione-Latium fieroe in wer—

Thee mother-queens of berberous ohiefteins own,

i
Thee Docian rough-thee Scythian wando-ing Ι

And purple tyrants tremble at thy frown.

Do not-oh! do not with destructive blow-
Now firmly fix'd-our oolumn overthrow3
Nor orush our state with faotion's fieree alarino,

While rebel-riot shriekS, “to arms-to arms ! ''

See dire Neoessity precede thy bend,
With spikes end wedges in her breton hond 3

Where-torture's horrid troin-the hook severos

And molten leod, in grim may appear.
