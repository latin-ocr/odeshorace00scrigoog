ODE XXXI.

ΤΟ APOLLO.

Wm asks the bard at Delos' shrine,

Whose goblet pours its earliest wine?
Not the rich storo of golden grain,
Which gilds Sardinia’s fenile plain ;

Not flocks from hot Calabria's shore3
Not gold, nor India’s ivory store3

’ Nor lands, where Liris' waters stray,

And-silent-eat their banks away.

Ye‚ who Calenian vines possesS,
With pruning-knife their shoots repress ;
Merchants, your golden goblets drain -

Barter'd away for syrian gain 3
