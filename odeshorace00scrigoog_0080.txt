ons xxxv. ΟΡ HORACE. 61

Thee Hope reveren, and Faith in white-rob'd pride,
-Attendnnt still at Fortune’s fickle side-

Ost as thou’rt pleas’d to change thy garb in hate,

And quit the mansione hs the fallen great.

But the false vulgar, and the pe1ju1²d fair,
¹ And friends—untaught afriend’s distress to bear-
When fails at length the cnsk's exhausted stone,

Drain the last goblet-and retum no more 1

, Oh ! save our chief, who sails for Britain’s land,

Remotest earth 1-0h! save the youthful band,
The terror noon of many nn Eashern shore,

Of lands where Anah sens their currente pour.

Shame on our civil discord !-what has time,

What has our harden’d age accounted crime?

Our youth what wrong abhorr’d?-from what ab·
stain’d‚

By fea'r of heaven, or piety restrain’d?
