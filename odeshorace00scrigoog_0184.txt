ena xxm, on nonnen. 165

When blacken’d billows, fearful, roar,
And lneh, with furious stroke, the shore.

’Twas thus Europa dnn'd confide
To the seign’d bull her snowy side:

Blnnnh’d her bold cheek - the fraud display’d -
As ocean's monsters she snrvejd3

who lnte to flowers her earn eonfin’d‚

And chaplets meet for nymphe to bind,

Now nothing throu'gh the night espiee* · s
But boundless wnves, and stany skies;

Who, when she toueh’d the Cretan coasts,
-Crete, which a hundred eities boasts ! -

“ Fnther! ” she eried -with fury wild —
“ Oh 1 piety 1-011 Ξ lost name of child!
Whenee‚ whither come ? - one death alone

Can scarce a virgin’s fault atone.
