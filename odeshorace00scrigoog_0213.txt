Diana's carel whose winged dart

Stays the swift lynx and flying hart,
Proserve the Lesbian numbers now,
And mark the hand’s direofing blow.

Duly the silvery crescent-moon,
Propitious to the fruits of earth,
Whence rapid months derive their birth.

“ I sang the ode, by gods approv’d,

The poet Horace wrote - and lov’d ! ''
