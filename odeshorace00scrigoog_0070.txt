onn xxvm. OF HORAOE· 51

And thus, whate'er the eastern breeze
May threaten to Hesperia's seas,

Let Venusinian woodlands ohafe,

But thou, my friend, shalt still be safe.
On every side shall riohest freight -
Deriv'd from Jove — thy hopes await3
Or N eptune’s gift, far ruling o’or

The sweet Tarentum's sacred shore.

But shouldst thou now avert thy face,

Curses upon thy hapless raee i

My ourses both on thern and thee 1

And for thy crima its penalty !

Not fruitless prayers shall mount from me3
Thy guilt no expiatione free.

Though hunying— short is the delay -
Thriee east the dust; then haste away·
