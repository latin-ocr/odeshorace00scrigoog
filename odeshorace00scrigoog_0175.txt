ODE XXIII.

ΤΟ PHIDYLE.

11² suppliant hands to Heaven you threw,
My Phidyle, when the moon was new;
If incense, fruits‚ and ravening swine

Should grace thy Lares' sacred shn'ne3

Nor poisonous south thy vine should taste,
Nor barren blight thy corn-fields waste 3
Nor thy sweet plants the seaeon sear,
Which threatens the autumnal year.

The viatim in Algidian enom,
Or which by oak, or holm-troo grows,

Or rich Albanian pestures feed,
Beneath the priestly knife shall bleed„ ¹
