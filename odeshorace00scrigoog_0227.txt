ODE XHI.

ho LYCE.

Tha gods have heard me, Lyce, now:
Lyae, the gods have heard my vow:
Your time-worn heauties you display,
And impudently quaff, and play;

And tardy cupid would engage,

With voice impair’d by drr'nk and age.
He the melodious Chian seeks,

And perches on her dimpled cheeks; y

Scarning the wither'd- sapless bough, ⁴

He stares ho view that haggard brow ! -
Since grizzled head, and blacken’d moth,
-With wrinkles -moek thy would-be youth.
Nor Coan purple’s graeeful fall,

Nor jewels bright, those years retal,
