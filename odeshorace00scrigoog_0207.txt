-With praise increas'd-till then the uncon·
quer’d might,

And wages wars - the listening wives’ delight. —

No boastful heralde Ι to Carthage send,

All hope, alas! has foundatimeless end3 ’

For Asdrubal- my Asdrubal! -is dead?
Nought baffles now the undaunted claudian line,
Which Jove defends, with deity benign,

And prudent caution leads securely on

Throughallthe toils and suares in warfare known„ ·
