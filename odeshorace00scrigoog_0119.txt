100 onns

But Faunus' hand preserv'd me then,
-The guardian kind of learned men 3-
Thou victims bring - the votive shrine -r Q

The offering of a lomb be mine !

ODE XVIII]

Non ivery shall my roos behold,

Nor arch bedizen’d o’er with gold3

Nor there Hymettian rafters stand

On columns, oarv’d from Afrie’s land3
Nor have I seiz'd— an heir unknown -
of Attalus the palene-throne3

Nor do I Spartan purple wear,

Which elients' gentle hands prepare.

But wit end honour still are mine,

And with the rich -though poor -I dine.
