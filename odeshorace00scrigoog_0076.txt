ΤΟ ALBIUS TIBULLUS.

Tm me, my Albius, tell mo why
For oruel Glycera oill you sigh?
Why of her broken saith complain,—
Her passion for a younger swain?
Fair LycoriS, os beautoous' brow,
With love of Cyrus rogos now:

¹ Cyrus on scornful Pholo& doato ;
But sooner shall tho mountain-goats
Mingle with wolves’ Apulian raoo,

Α Thon Pholoh' love the adulterer boso.

Of Venus such the sovereign will!
She, whose moh‘gnant sportis still
Tho difforing form, ond varying mind,

Together in hor¹ yoko to bind.
