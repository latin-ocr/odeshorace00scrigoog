om: vr. or nonnos. 127

Tire virgin, as her years advenere,

Delights w leem the Ionian denne ;

Her ehildish limbs she- graeeful — moves,
And meditates unhullow’d loves.

Soon -while her lord his revel keeps -—
Το younger arms the adulteress leeps3

Not choosing whom-when quench'd the lightn-

To lawless rapture she ,invites3 '
But ready et each eall to rise,

Before her husband's eonseious eyes,
If faetor, or if Spanish mete
Buy the disgraee at precious rare.

Α youth, from parents unlike these,
With Punic blood distain’d our sees,
The great Antiochus o'erthrew,
And Hannibal and Pyrrhus slew ι

··- A rustic soldiery from their birth -
Who turn’d with Sabine spade the eerth;
