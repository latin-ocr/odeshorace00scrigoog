Not Auster, ruling Adria's strand3

Nor Jove’s great fulminating hand3

’Mid wreck os worlds, and ruin’d sphera,
Undaunted still his soul appears!

Thus Pollux and Alcides boast

Their seats ’mid heaven's refulgent host ;

With whom Augustus now reclines,

Purpling his lip with heavenly wines;

Unwonted yoke thy tigere hear 3

So Mars supphes hls swiltest steeds,
And Romulus from Acheron speeds.

’Twas then, when Juno silence broke,
- The Gods approving as she spoke -
“ O, Ilion! Ilion! brought to dust

By fatal judge’s wauton lust,

And foreign fair - what time to heaven
Laomedon's salse oath was given -
Condemn’d to Pallas and to me

Thy rate, - thy leader’s perfidy t ·-
