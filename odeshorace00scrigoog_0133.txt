Thebn'lliant guest no more is seen

of Sparta’s fair adulterous queen ;
, Nemore shall P1iam'e house withstand

-By Hecter'e eid -·- the Grecian band ;

Wers - lengthen'd out by diseord —eease

Retiring to give place to peace.

Heneefonh my anger shell abate

Towards him -the object of my hate 3
My grandson I to Mars restore, ⁴
Whom lete the Trojan prieetess bore;
He now to heavenly seete shall haste,
And nectar'e brimming goblets taste3
With gods enroll’d, 111111 -trenquil- rest
For ever with the immortal blest.
From Reme to Γ11ογ while foams the main

— As exiles- lei them happy reign3

01⁰ Paris’ end of Priam’s huet,

“
While herds insult the marble dust 4
Where sevege beasts their offepring hide, y

The Capitol 1111111 soar in pride ;
