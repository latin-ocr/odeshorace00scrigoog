ODES

Plane me too near Apollo’s car,
- From human habitatione far -
E'en there my Lalage beguileS‚
Who eweetly telks - end sweetly smiles. ῃ

ODE xxm.

ro onnon.

“ Lmn the young fenne, my chloes ssight,
φο seeks her dam on pathless height,

And vainly dreads the harmless breem,

¹ Or starts at the surrounding trem.

For whether the approach of spring
Sets the young *leaflets quivering,

Or lizerds green disturb the brake,
Her henrt and knees with terror shake.
