onom OF HORAGE.

still grieves thy love at Vesper’s nise,

And when Apollo mounts the skien.
Not he, who trebled nature's yearS,
Shed for Antilochus constent tears;
Nor sire, nor sistere always weep

The youthful Troilus' untimely sleep.

Cease then thy vein -unmenly grief,

And sing the trophiee of our chief,

- The spoil of Oaesor's eonqnering hand —
And oold Niphates' ico-bound strend;
How, added oo our vanquish’d foeo,

Medus in humbler eddy flows;

And how Gelonion horsemen ride

In narrow’d limito, ond with leseen’d pride.
