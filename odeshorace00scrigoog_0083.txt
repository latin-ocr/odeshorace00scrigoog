ODES noox 1. ¹:

’Twae impious to produce before 1
Our Oaeeuban's ancestral ehore3

While the fair queen of Egypt'e sees - ἱ
With bend infected by diseese ·-

still menao’d with disastrous fate

The Capitol, end Romen state, -
Whom-drunk with favoun'ng fortune’s smile-

ΤΙιθ idlest hopes could still beguile: p

But scarce one ehip, preserv'd from fleme,
Suffie’d her furious wrath to tame3

When Caesnr teffified her seul,-
Though moisten’d in the Egyptian bowl -

Pureuing, with his repid oar,

Her flight from the Itnh‘en shore 3
The fatal monster to reetrein,
And bind in hie relentless ehein.
