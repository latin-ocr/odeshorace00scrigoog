ουκ 1. OF HORAGE.

J un0‚ with gods who cherish’d more,

But fail'd to avenge the Afric shore, '
Brought back-to appeese J ugurtha’s ghost-
The sons of the victorious host.

What lands- by impious slaughter fed —
But mark with tombs where Latians bled?
While still the distant Medes proelaim

Τὴθ ruin dire of proud Hesperia’s name.

What gulfs - what rivers, as they flow,
But our lamented warfare know ἲ

What sea but rocks a purpled flood?
What shore unstein'd by Daunian blood?

ί 4 ff ὕ ³*

Then eease not, sauey Mure, thy joke;

Nor Oeen funeral-streins invoke 3
But come thy lighter harp to wield‚

In Dionaean cave -with me-sseonceal’d. ’ ’“
