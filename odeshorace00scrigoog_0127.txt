Some love their neighbours 10 outvie
In planting groves 3 - some fain would try

The field of Mars with nobler aim 3
This trusts to virtue orto fame3

That boasts his numerous client-crowd3
But death 1010011 the poor and proud
With equal law ;—the spacious urn

Revolves each name in fatal turn.

The wretch, who views the impending sword,
Turns - sichening - from Sicihan board ;
Nor song of birds, nor 11111110 more·

His peaceful slumbers sh'all restore ;

That 10001101010, which gently 11101

Το 01010 the lowly rustic's eyes ;

Which loves sweet Tempe’s shadowy vale,
Fann'd by the zephyr’s gentlest gale.
