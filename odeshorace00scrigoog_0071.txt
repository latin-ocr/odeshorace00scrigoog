ODE XXIX.

ΤΟ lccms.

Ιοοῐῦε, whose visions love to rest '
On golden “Araby the blest‚” ’

To bid the lineonquer’d Saba meod,
And bind in chains the horrid¹Mede,-

Her own betroth'd admirer slain Ρ-
What boy appoint thy cup to bear,

What barbarous virgin shalt thou gain, ' Ι

From gorgeous hall — with perfim’d hair-

†
Skill’d with paterno] bow to try j

ι The Serio darm-who dares deny
'rbat streame may up the mountains glide‚ ]

ι’

And Tiber'swavesbeturn'daside? Α
