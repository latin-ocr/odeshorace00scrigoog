ODE X.

ΤΟ MERCURY.

Hm, Meroury! from old Atlas sprung,

Well-skill'd, with eloquenoo of touguo‚
And the palaestra’s graoeful gamo,

The ruge of earliest man to tame3

Herald of gods and mighty J ovo,

The parent of the lyre you love!

Tbee would I sing, whose pilfering pride
Delights each sportivo theft to hide.

When Phoebus, with his throutoning brow,
Bade you the stolen boeves avow,
He lough'd‚ to find a boy like you
Had robb'd him of his quiver too.
