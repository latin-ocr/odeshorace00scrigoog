Let serpente break the appointed course,
Cressing —like darts —the affrighted horse ;
While I, with augur’s prudent care,

The raven ronse in eastward prayer,

Before the bird -portending rain-
shall seek the stagnant pools again.
Still blest may Galatea be,

And mindful still of love -and me !

Nor wandering erow, nor luekless pye,

Aeross her course- portentous - fly 1

Orion’s slanting rays I sear -

Mark, how he trembles in his sphera!

Well know I Adria’s darhening sees,
And fair Iapyx' treacherous breeze.

Let wives and children of our foes

Tremble when rising Auster blows3
