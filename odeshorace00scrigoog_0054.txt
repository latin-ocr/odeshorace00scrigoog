Tho gods defend me z-nor refuso
My piety -- my votive Muoe.
Hero too by thoe shall plenty's horn,
With rurol honours full, be borne ;
Saso in tho vole from Sirius’ heat,
On Teian stringo sholt thou repeat
Penelope, and Circo’s fame,
— The victims of a common flamo. -
Here, quaffing hormless Lesbian wine,
'Mid well-fill’d copo, in shodo recline ;
Nor Somolo's infuriato son

With Mars in maddening conflict run.

No sear lost Cyrus’ wauton might
Should seize theo in unequal fight3
Th5⁷ inoffensive garments tear,

And rend the chaplet from thy hair.
