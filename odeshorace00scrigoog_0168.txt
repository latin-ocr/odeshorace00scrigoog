ons: xvm. OF HORACE. 149

Pile up the logs t — 'tis dry to-day ι -
Wine shall to-morrow’s cares alley3

'shy board supplied with two-mouth pork,
Th)r household slaves releas'd from work!

ODE XVIII.

TO FAUNUS.

nunus, of flying nymphe the swain,
My beundsries, and the shedy plain

- Gentle- approach ς but come not nigh

My little favour'd nursery3 ·

If falls a tender kid eaeh' year,
And bumpers fiow -- to Venus dear 1 -
And stin, above the ancient shrine,

The smoke and frankineense combine.
