ODE XIV.

ΤΟ THE munuc.

Sum ebbing waters bear thee back,
Poor vessel, on thy watery track?
What wouldst thou ?- Safeat {mehor ride 3-

Thy oarage fails the vessel’s side ;

Thy mast-with rapid Afrie's wound -
Thy oreaking yard·arms groan around.
scarae ean thy eordless keel sustain

The shocks of the imperious main.

Thy sails flap -ragged-on the air,

And heaven disdains the afflicted prayer.
What though -a Pontio pino -you stood,
- The daughter of a noble wood -
