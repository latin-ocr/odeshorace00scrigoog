Oh! though norpresents, prayerS, nor lover's choek
of pallid hue-with violets’ mingling otroak -
Nor husband- wounded by Pierian fair -

To pity bend, oh! yet thy suppliant spare3

Thou, than tho sturdy oak less form’d to break,

With mind less pitying than the Moorish snake! η

Not always will this weary side sustoin
Thy oruel throshohh and this pelting rain.

ODE XI.

Mwwowww, by whose tuneful oid,
The rocks Amphion’s voice oboy’d,
And thou, my lyre, whose musio floats

—In melody-from seven swoot notho,

- Though once neglectod - now thy shaiws,

HarmoniouS, swell at feasts and fanos -
