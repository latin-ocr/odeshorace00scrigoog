om: 1111. OF HORAGE.

1111111-1111111 terror shakes my soul,

With motous joys from eopious b0w13

Evoe t -spare me, Bacchus, spate 3

Youf who the dreaded thyrsus bear!

Of wauton Thyads be my song,
And fountains pouring wine along ;

Of fruitful streams with milk that fl0w‚
And trunks—whose honey drops below:

To smg thy blessed spouse be mine,

Now rais’d among the stars to shine;
The ruin dire of Pentheus' hall,

And-Thracian king—Lyeurgus' fall

Streams and barbarian oceans roll
Obedient still to thy control ;
Thou bind'st in some lone mountain spot,

Bistoniam curls in viper knot.
