But for the price of Chian wine. . . . “

Who finds the house, where we may dine . γλ ’

When these Pehgnian frosts shall cecse . ,ζ .
Who hects the heth . . . . you hold your peace !

Here's to the young mcon’s crescent bright!
Now, boy, a bumper to the night !

Now to Murena i—three or nine

Be fimffl as guests incline3

Your bard, who loves the hneven Muses,
Three times three- enraptussd-chooses ;
The Graces sear such heisterous pleaeures,
And limit us to triple mensures.

Still let me rave l - why, why are mute

The breathings of the Phrygian flute?

Why hange it with the silent lyrc?

I hate spch niggard hands ς - fling higher!

Fling roses up i—our noisy cheer

Let envious hyena, listening, hear,

With her-his ill-match’d neighbour near.
