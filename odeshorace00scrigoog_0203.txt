· ODE IV.

As thunder’s minister (the royal bird,

On whom great J ove—the sire of gods-eonfen'd

The rule o'er feather’d tribes—the well-earn’d
meed

of heavenward ssight with-feirheir'd Ganymede)

Firet youthful buoyaney and native might

Draws from his nest - uneonseious yet of flight-

Then - wintry tempests 0'er - the galee of spring
Teach him, ἡαπ-Μ, ω hythe unwonoed wing;

soon, soaring wide in strength-'s impetuous gIow,

Downwards he wheels,-0f grezing floeks the foe3—
Now thirst of prey end love of fight ewake
His fieree encounters with the struggling snake:—

Or, aethe goat, whom smiling pastures phase,
When the young lion’s first approeeh she seeS,
