ODE XIV.

ΤΟ THE Roma.

Roma, Augustus, having aought‚

The wraath by daath and danger bought,
-Like graat Alcides—now from Spain,
Victorioua, saeka hia gods again3

Lat the fond wife, who welaomes home
The paarlass lord of princely Rome,

ss Her sacred ritas perform’d - appear

With fair Octavia moving near3

There let the matrona crown their hair,
-The mothera of the brava and fair -
While suppliant filleta grace the brow

For youths and maida - in safety now :
Nor let the dark, ill-oman'd word

Among the youthful crowd be heard.
