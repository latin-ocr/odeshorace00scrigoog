190 ODES aoox 1v. ”

-Absent twelve waary months from har emhraae—
Nor from the curving shore averta her face —
Thus loyalty and love our bosoms burn,

Awaiting great Augustus' saie return.

The oxen then securely roam the field,
Ceres and Plenty their abundance yield‚
' ΤῙιθ aailors on the tranquil waves rejoice,

And honour fears our Caesar’s censuring voice.

Ἴ Adultery stains not the untainted line,
Custom and law t0 aheak the vice combine;

The father’s features in the son wa praiae,

And speady punishment the crime betraya

Who Parthia dreads ? - who frozen Scythia seara?
Who tha rough offspring that Germania rears?

When Coeaar - saie-revisita Rome again,

Who fears tha contest with farocious Spain?
