ODE VIII.

ΤΟ MAEcENAs.

In the Calends of Msreh what - unmarried -I do,

Why my censer bresthes incense, why flowerets I

strewm
And why ceals on live turs are‘ dIspos'd, you would

seek, χ
And you wonder-though skill’d both in-Latin

and Greek. -
To Bacchus a feast, and white goat I deeree,
Having lately eseap'd from the fall of a tree3
This day shall be kept, es the sesson eomes round,

- And the cork shall bs drawn- though with piteh

it is bound ; -
The cask has drunk smoke in the cellar below,

Since Tullus was consul— some lustres ago! -
