ουκ 1x. OF nomon. 199 ⁵

The Muse forbids that man to die,
Whose praise deserves -attojns the sky! ,
Alcides thus- his labours done—-

The envied feasts of Jove has won3
Thus the min-stara in safety keep
The shatter'd bark that sails the deep ;

Thus Bacchus wreathes his vine-crown’d hair,
And perfecte still his votasy's prayer.

ODE IX,

ΤΟ LOLLIUS.

Tum( not my lays perchanee shall live no more,
Though lisp’d at first by Aufid’s echoing shore 3
LayS‚ over which the lyre's melodious ming, '

With art -as yet untried -would music fling.
