(oms v1. OF nomen.

ODE VI.

ΤΟ AGRIPPA.

’ VARms thy courage shall recito,
In stanzas of Moeonian flighm

How conquer'd foes by sea andland

Fledss from Agrippa's warlike band. -
But heights like these affright my lyf¹e3

Pelides’ bold, unbending ire-
Ulysses’ weary route to trane·

Through eoas-and Pelops' eruel race ;-··
{whilst modesty would fain refusa,
’ἢ lnd Rome's unwarlike lyrio Muse,

¹&reat Oaesar'S, and Agn'ppa's praise
ῃ) lessen by unworthy lays.
