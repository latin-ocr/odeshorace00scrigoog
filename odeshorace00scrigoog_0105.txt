ODE XI.

To anwms fflRPmUS.

WHAT plans Cantabria’s warlike state,

What Scythian chiese may meditate,

Hirpinus Quintius, seek not now,

Since Adria's waves between us flow. ι

Fear not—since little life requires ; Ι

¹ Gay youth - with beauty - quick retires 3
{Whle every hoary look that grows

still steals from love- still mars repose.

The vernal flowers are first to Μω-
The ruddy moon oft sets in shade3 —
Why then fatigue thy anxious mind,

Why not, at ease, enj yoy our wine,

Beneath this lofty plane or pine‚

For cares eterna} undesign’d? }
