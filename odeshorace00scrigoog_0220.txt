ουκ 1x. or northon. 201

Before Atrides many a hero breve,

Unwept - unknown -hoe sought the shadowy
grave 3

In derk oblivion’e depths oondemn’d to etrey,

Since mute for him the herd’s immortel lny3

For hidden velour - in unnoted tomb ι·-

But shores of oowardioe the inglorious doom.¹

Thy arduous doeds derk Lethe shall survive,
And thou, my holliuS, in these lines shelt live.

Thine is the minti for stotesmon'e prudenoe known,

Unmov’d alike if Fortuno smile or frown3
Avenging greedy fraud ; — nor sway’d by gold,
Attraoting au within its grasping hold:

Nor with tho year thy oonsul'e offioe dies, Ι
Surviving still, while honest - virtuous — wiso -
Preserring honour to the proffer'd goin,

Thou spurn'st perfidious bribes with proud disdein;
While thy pure soul, in honour's armour, glows ,

With virtue's triumph 0’er her blushing foes.
