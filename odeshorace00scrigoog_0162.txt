ons ΧΠ. OF HORAOE. 143

For me - this truly festiva day
Desponding aare shall drivs away3
While caesar yet on earth appears,
Nor death nor tumulas wake my fears.
Bring odours-wrsaths-and wine, whose seal
And date the Massian war revenh

If yet a aask remains ao us,

Untapp'd by wandering Spartacus:
And bid Neaera-tunsful maid 1-

In simple knot her tressss braid ;

But should her porter cause delay,

Then tarry not, - but hasta away ;
. Tha h0a1y hairs of after life

Dissuade the ona-time weleome stn'fe3

Not tamely thus my pulsas beat
When Plancus fill’d the aonsul's seat,
