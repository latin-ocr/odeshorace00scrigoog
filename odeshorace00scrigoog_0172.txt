While at thy side swift arrows hang,
While whete the nymph her dreaded fang,
The umpire smiles in cerelees calm,

And spurns, with naked foot‚ the palm ;

Refreshing‚ with the gentle air,

His shoulder -spread with perfum'd hair:
So Nireus- eo the stripling smil’d

From Ida's watery hrow beguil’d»

ODE ΧΧΙ.

ΤΟ ms CASK.

Mi honour'd cask, whose birth may date
-Like mine -from Manlius' consulate 3
Whether sweet sleep, complaint, or jest,

Or love’s wild frolics suit thee best 3
