om: Π, OF HOBAOE.

Dropsy by sels-indxflgenee grown
Nor thirst dopna-ts, while, lingering, fiows
The cause of ill within the veins‚

And watery languor- pale - remains.

Virtue, who spuma the crowd’s haheat,
Excludes Phraates from the bloet,
· On Cyrus’ throne 3-and bids us fly

The seeming truth - the specious lie3

The crown, the laurel, and the throne,
Conferring upon him alone,

Whose eye -undazzled-can behold
Enormous heaps of tempting· gold.
