om: xm. OF HORACE.

And where Alcaeus’ strings of gold,

Seas — flight — and warfare’s ills unfold.
Both strains the admiring shades declaro
Fit music for the silent air3

But banish'd kings, undisongs of fight‚
The ears of shouldering crowds delight.

What wonder Ξ υ- when, at that sweet sound,
Hangs his blank ears the astonish’d hound
With hundred heads 3 — soft tonos l which lull
The Furies' looks, of serpents full:
Prometheus, too, and Pelops' sire,

’ ss-Sooth’d by the strain-no longer tire3
v Nor dreams the bold Orion more

Of timid lynx, or lion’s roar.
