ODES reor 1. ⁸

And o'er the weves seeurely beer

Half of my seul-thy preeious care!

Steut eelz, Ι πθθυ,’ end triple fold

of braes begr'rt hie bosom bold,

who, first, his fragile vessel gave

To seil upon the ruthless weve3

Where Afn'eus, in fiet-rege,

And stormy Aquilo engege 3

Nor fear’d the mournful Hyedee '
Nor angry Notus’ boieterous breem,

Than whom no greater power presides,
Το lesh or lull the Adrian tides.

What form of death eould terrify

Theman, who view'd‚ with teerless eye,
Sea-monsters huge- the tempest's shoeks-
Acroceraunie's ill-femed rocks?

Τὴο prudent deity in vain

The earth dissevers from the mein,
