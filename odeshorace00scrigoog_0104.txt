ome x. ΟΕ HORAOE.

Well-tutor’d minde the changeful morrow
still sear in joy—still hope in sorr0w;

The same great Jove who winter bringS, ’

Smiles on the sest succeeding spn'ngs. s

Not always will missortunes lovegg,
Because w-day we feel their power ;Ι

For Phoebus oft resigns the bow,
And bide the lyrie Muses glow.

Should plenty eease thy steres to fill,
Show thyeelf brave and daunssless still ;
And eo eontraet thy ewelling sails,
'Mid fortune's too propitious galee.
