202 ODES noox ιη’.

Not the rich man, of boundless wealth possess'n
Can justly claim the attnn'bute of “ blees'd ;'’

To him more truly may the name be given,

Who wisely guards the choioest gifts of heaven;
Who pinching poverty wffl feerless face,

And while he dreads not death, yet· loathes disgraee3
Eeger in honousss cause his life to end,

Prepar’d to die for country or for friend.

When curls no longer o'er thy shoulders spread,
And from thy eheek the dnmask rose is fied,
