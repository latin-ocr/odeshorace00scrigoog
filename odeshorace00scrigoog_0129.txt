. Since then nor Pthgian stone, nor hue

Of glitoering mantle's sunniest blue‚

Nor juice from deep Falernian bowl,

Nor Persian perfume‚ soothes the soul,

Why rear the dome in modern taeta,
With envy·m0ving columns grac’d?
Or why exchange my Sabine vale,
Tloe toils of riches vo entail?

ODE H.

Ι Lm youth, robust in wmfare, leam
The straits of poveny to spurn3
Let him the Parthian’s furious ruge,
A knight‚ with dreaded spear engage;
Be still our youthful warrior's life

In open air- 'mid soenes of strise.
