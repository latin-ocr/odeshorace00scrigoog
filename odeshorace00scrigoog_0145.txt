Thy veunted power -thy reign was given,
For lowliness to gods ond heaven3

These eleim thy prayers -the wer began, -
Thy grateful thenks - the victory won.

The gods- contemn'd - missortunes pour

Upon Hesperie’s hopless shore.
Monaeses now and Peoorus’ hordeo

Have twice repell'd our luckless swerds;
Whose petty oollers veinly boeot

A booty by the Romen lost.

Rome ell but bent - sedition’s prey-

To Dedan, end to AEihiop swey3
This, famous in the nevel fight,

Theo, for his errow's winged ssight.

Fertile in orime, the times disgreoe

The marriage bed - our homes -our reoe;
And daughter, flowing from this source,
O'er Rome end Romans holds its course.
