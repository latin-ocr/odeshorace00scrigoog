ODES noox 111. ¹

Onoe cover’d 0’er with verdant leaf ;
— A legend, held in unbelief
Through Acherontia, Bantine woodS,
And low Ferentum's fertile roodS,

That I should slumber sweetly there,
Safe from the viper and the bean
— Laurel and myrtle o’er me pil’d -—
A little god-protected child 1

Your5‚ Ο ye Muses ! yours am I,
Whether the Sabine region high,
¹ Praeneste cold, or Tibur’s shore,

Or watery Baiae please me more.

Me, whom your founts and sports delight,
N either Philippi’s fatal fight
Destroy’d, nor yon accursgfftree,

Nor Sicily's tempestuous sea.
