And monarehs‚ who from gods descend,
Who dealt the monster-centaurs death,

η And quench’d Chimaera’s fiery breath3

Or drestler bold, or conquering steed‚

’ -Great Pindar’s muse their proudest meod!—

Or the young lord if he deplord
Whom death from weeping fair-ond bore,

Whose strength-whose mind-whose golden days

Quit Orcus now for Pindar’s lays,

Direaean swans the breezes bear,
Through floating clouds, in highest air ς
But, like the small Matinian hee,

Who tofis, AntoniuS, patiently,
