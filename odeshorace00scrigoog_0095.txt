ODES

ODE V.

UNABLE yet the yoke to bear,
Unfit a partner’s toils to share3

To meet the monarch of the drove,

Rushing— in mad career-on love,

Thy heifer's inclination leads

Ι ’ Το frisk about the verdant meads ;

Sporting - to shun the solar boam -
With bun-calm, in the willow stream.

Awhile the unripe grape decline ;
Since soon sor thee the clustering vine,
Autumn -with ever-varying hue -

’ shall with its purplest tinge imbue.

Soon she’ll pursue, -tim flows apaoe,
YearS, stolen from thee, on her to plaee3
Soon Lalage, with wauton gait,

Herself shall seek a fitting mate,
