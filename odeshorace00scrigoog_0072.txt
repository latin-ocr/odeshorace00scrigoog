· Since - widely sought - thy learned storo,
Penae‘cian ond Socratio lore- ¹.
Thon, form’d in learning’s potho tc shine,

Would'st now for Spenish arms resign.

ODE XXX.

ΤΟ VERUS.

On Cnidos end of Paphos queen,
Qun, Venus, quit thy Cyprion scene,
To light on Glycero's lovely bewer,

thse plenteous incense now invokes thy power.

With nymphs and glowing Cupio hoste,
And Grecos -- with their zonelcss waiet:
Let Meromy thy escort be,

And youth, who owes his sweetest eherm to thee!
