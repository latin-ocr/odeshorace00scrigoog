ons xv. OF HORAOE.

“ What! fear’st thou not Laertes' crafty tage,

- Foe to thy tace ?- and Nestor- Pylian sago?
see Salaminian Teucer urge thy flight ;

And Sthenelus, so skilful in the fight,

“ Reining his stssds -tremendous eharioteer 1 -
And see dsrk Merion's fie1y coursers near!
Fierce Tydeus’ son *. superior to his sire -

still seeks thee out, with all a foeman's ire:

“ As from a wolf- across the valley seen —
Flies the scar'd stag, and quits the pasture green,
Thus Paris flies, by panting¹ breath delay'd,
—Not such the promise to thy mistress made 1 -

“ Achilles' angry fleet shall still delay
To Troy, and Trojan dames the fatal day3

Till - winters rolling on - the Grecian fire

Shall raise 0'er Trojan domes the funeral-pyrel'
