our: 'xm OF Horror.

Skilful the lietening ooks to bring
Attendent on his tunefrrl etring.
What theme shall eloim the poet’e lays
Before our Sire’s oooustom'd praise?
Who governs with omniscient ken
Immortel godo, and mortel men 3
And sheds o’er oea, and land, ond sky
The reasons' sweet variety.
From him no power superior flows,
Nor equal he— no second knowe;
Whom nought created eon excel ;Ι

¹ Himself his only parallei

Stiil next in honor's glorioue bend
See Pallas-wisdom's goddess-stond3
Nor pass we Bocchus, bold in mian,
Nor thee the virgin himmas-queem
Nor Phoebus, thee, of deathloes farne,

Feer’d for thy dort's unerring eim.
