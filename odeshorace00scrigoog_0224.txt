Young Telephus, pursued by thee,
ἵ - Though far above thy own degree -—
¹ A rich and wanton maid deteins,

And holds him -bound in pleesing chains.

Let Phaeton - oonsum'd by fire —

Forbid the ambitione hope espire3

And Pegasus, in loftiest eir,
- Soorning the earth-born knighs to beer-

By terrible example teaeh

To abstain from hopes beyond our reaeh ;
Let these thy lofty eim reprove‚

And warn thee of unequel love.

Come then -oh ! come, my latest fleme,
(Henoeforth no other beans that name),
Let thy lov'd voice my numbers ny,

Since dismal cares from musio fly.
