30 ODES noox 1.

“ In ill-storr'd honr, you homowords bear thc dome,
Whom Grecoe in serriod warfare shall roclaim3
Togcthcr swom thy nuptiale to destroy‚

And agcd Pricm's ancient realm of Troy.

“ What sweat from war-horso pours - from 'war-
rior’s foco!

What funeral-pyros afflict the Trojcn racc!

Evcn now hor holm and shield Minerva tn'cS,

Her ohariot proves —· while furious glauce hor eyeS.

“ In Venus' guardianship then bold in vain,

You comb your looks3 and, in effeminate sorcin,

Tune tho divisions of tho unocriike lyre. —

In vain the spears—to nuptial couches dire-

“ In vain tho Orcccn dans and shouts you shun,
In vain from Ajax' swift pursuit you run.

Alos! those curlo thot pleas'd tho wanton's lust
shall troil-though lato - in tho avenging duct.
