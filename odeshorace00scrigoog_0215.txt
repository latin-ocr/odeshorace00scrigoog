1 196 onas mox η.

Revolving moons their waninge still repair3
But we, alas! when once descended there,

Where good AEneas, Tullus, Ancus lie,
As dust reposo — as empty shadows fly.

Who - who can tell, if heaven’s supernal sway
Shall add a morrow to the passing day? =
Whate’er thy fanoy’s frolio mood shall shape‚ “

All shall thy heir's remorseless hands escape:

Onoe touoh'd the confines of the dismal tomb -
Lot Minos onoe pronounoe thy awfnl doom -
Nor birth, Torquatua nor thy eloquenoe‚

Not e’en thy virtue, shall reoal thee thence.

Tho ohaste Hippolytus Diana’s might
In vain would resoue from the realms of night ;

While Theseus’ friendly power essay’d in vain
To break Pirithous’ Lethaean chain.
