128 ODES Boon 111.

Or, groaning under piles of wood‚
Obey’d a mother's rigorous mood;
what time the mountain shadows change,

And loosen'd oxen love to range3

As Phoebus - with retiring wheels -
Points where the graveful evening stem.
What does not threatening time presago?

Worse than their sires', our fathers’ age

Produc'd ourselves still worse —in time

To blush for sons more stain’d by crime.

ΤΟ ASTERIE.

Wm weeps Asterie ἲ why deplore
Whom spring's first zephyrs shall restore,
Blest with Bithynian freight?- a youth,
Thy Gygae, of inviolate truth!
