Minos, in whom μω Jove confides -
And Tartarus Pythagoras hides,

Dismiss’d ω hell- though proud to wield,
Unfix'd, his monumental shield3

A witness from the wars of Troy,

That Fate can but our frames destr0y3

¹ Him no inferior judge you (leem,

With truth and nature for his theme.

All -all await one dark abodo,

All - 1111 must tread one fatal road.
Some ’mid the pomp of wmfare blood,
While some the greedy ocean foed:

The old-the youthful —- mingling, fall:
Proserpine, cruel, elaims them all.

Me too Orion's setting beam

Has plung'd in the Illyrian stream ;
But do not, sailor, grudge to spread
Some nand upon my tombless heaael
