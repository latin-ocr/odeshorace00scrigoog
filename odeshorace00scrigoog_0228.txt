ona xm. OF Honhcn. 209

Which winged time, in passage fase

Hae elos’d ’mid annale of the pest.

Where is thy love- thy beauhy fiown?
'Ihat graeeful bearing -all thine own ?-
Where now, ah! where shall she be sought,
Whose every breath with love was fraught?
What -what of her remains to-day‚

Who stole me from myself away?

Whose sace - with every pleaeing wile -
Yielded alone te Cinera’s smile 1

But fate has eut my Oinara’s thread,
Though guarding Lyee's ancient head ;

- Aneient as ynnder veteran erow 1 —
That youth, with all its fervid glow,

In laughter’s merny line array'd,

Ι Might view the toreh in ashes laid.
