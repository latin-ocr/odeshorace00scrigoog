ODES soon 111,

Crime’s jailer there, with vulture's bill,
Mengles lewd Tityus' liver still3

While there three hundred links of ohnin
Pirithous, the lover, restrain.

ODE V.

Tnouon Jove in thunder rules the sky,

Eurth boasts her present deity,

Augustus! forging Brituin’s ohein,
And adding Parthia to his reign.

Hos Crassus' soldier dragg’d his life,
Base husband of barbarian wife?

Has Mursian, and Apulien bold,

On surm of hostile sire grown old,
(Oh 1' senate! morule ohang’d indeed !)
Forgetful — under roysl Mede -

of secred shield, of gown, end name

And Veste's never-dying fleme,
