our. 11. OF HORAGE. lll

Him, where some hostile towers wiso,

The royal warrior’s dame espieS,

- Some recent brido— who sighs afar,

Lest - yet alas! unskill’d in war -

Her royal spouso should oross his path}

Or wake tho lion-warrior's wrath;

Whose slaughtering steol’s insatiate blows Ἰ
Cleave the rod pathway through hio foes.

'Tio sweet -’tis proud for home to die!
Nay, death pursues when oowards fly3

Nor deigns to sparo the dastord traok

of trembling knees‚ and timorous book.
Virtue, disdoining ooward ssight,

still shines -with stainless honour bright;
Nor graspo nor yields hor onsigns proud‚

Ao veors tho inconstant, fiokle crowd.

'h Virtuo, expanding wido the sky

To those who merit not to die,
