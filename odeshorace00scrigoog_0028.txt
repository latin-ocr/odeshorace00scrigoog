’ oon 11. OF HORAOE.

We’ve seen the Tiber’s yellow tide
Rush- furious -from the Tuscan side,
Towards Numa’s royal buildings flow,

ἢ And Vesta’s temple overthrow.

The uxorious stream—with rapid wave -—
Avenges thus his Eia's grave 3

And -spite of Jove -his current pours,
Fierce eddying to the Latian shores.

Our youth—from parents' crimes how few ἒ-
shall Romans’ sharpen'd faichions view,
-Dhsign'd to quell the Parthian's ruge ·-

In discord’s civil strife engage.

What god shall now the people’s prayers
call to the ruin’d state’s affairs?
What hymn the sacred virgins raiae
Το Vesta- heedless of our lays?
