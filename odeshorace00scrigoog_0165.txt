The Greoian ougur's house, they tell,

Destroy'd by filthy luere, fell:
sse Macedonian oleft the getes,

Corrupting rival towns ond etates

By bribery, whose seductive eway
Our fieroest nevel ohiefs obey.

Coro follows weelth's inoreaeing storo,

- Cere ond the burning thirst for more l·-
Jusoy, opride of'knights, 1 oeae

To lift the for-conspicuous head:

The more we to oureelves deny,

The more the bounteous gods supply. ¹
Though poor, from evarioe still I hide,

And love to quit the rich men’s side;

Of narrow means e lord more proed,

Thon if, whate'er the Apellen plough’d

My well-stor'd grenary should hold,

-A pauper emid pilos of gold! -
