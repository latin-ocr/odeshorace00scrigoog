omi 1x. OF HORAOE.

Leave to the gods the rest : - when they
The bettling winds end waves allay,
Nor ancient ash, nor cypress more

Shall dread the tempest’s angry rear.
Unsought the morrow's fate remain, l
But eoimt the aecerded day as gain 3

Nor epum the danae, 1101· love's sweet vows,

While whiteness speres thy youthful brows.

Now for the Campm, andlthe park l
The gentle whisperings after dark l
The assignation l-Now the maid,
By leughter’s meniest peel betray'd,

Quits the sly eomer where she weteh‘d:
See, from her erm the pledge is snetch’d!
While now her finger yields the prize,
She half aecords -- yet half denies.
