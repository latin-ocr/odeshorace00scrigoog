ons xv. OF HORAOE. 215

On festive morns, and every day,

Let us- with sportive Bacchus gay—

* Our consorts and our children nigh,

-Appeasing first the deity-

Mingle with Lydian pipe our lays,
And ohant our valiant leaders’ praise,
Anchises old - Troy, now no more —-

And whom the gentle Venus bore.

THE END.
