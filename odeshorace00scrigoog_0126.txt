BOOK ΙΙΙ.

ΟΙ)Ε Ι.

Ι nme-1 epum the vulgar throng!

Attend 3-as yet unheerd the song, ’

Which, as the Muse’s priest I sing, ι

- The youths and maidens listeningi —

Dreed kings their subject vessels sway;
Monarchs themselves great Jove obey:
Supreme !—the giam-quelling god!
All nature trembling at his nod!
