ODE XVAs

Missis of royni buildings now

Have left few aeres for the plough ;

And boundless ponds a circle take

Far wider than the Lucrine leke3

The barren plane the oak 0’erp0wer5‚

And violets—myrtle—-noeegay-flowers -
Through olive-grounds have perfume pour'd,
Productive' to their former lord ;

While overhead the mantling beyn

Exclude Apollo’s fervid rays.

No change like this Quirinus saw3
Not such stern Cato’s ancient law ;
Small private means were theim, - but great

The proud revenue of the stete ; -
