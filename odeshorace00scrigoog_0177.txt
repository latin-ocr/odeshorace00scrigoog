If Fate, with adamantino nnil,

-· Cruel—thy proudest domes asseil,
still quails thy ooward mind with dread,
Denth's sueres still hnunt thine abject head.
Better the plain-born Scythian fares,
Whose wandering house a waggon bears;
Or Getae mugh, whose boundless plain,
spontaneous, yields its fruits and grein;
Whose tiuage tedious would appear

For longer than a single year3

who share elike the unmeasur’d soil -
Alike divide the farmeffs toil.

Here the new wife to orphans’ sighs

A mother’s loss and love supplies ;

No portion’d dame commnnds her sponse,
Nor truste the sleek adultereffs vows:
Parenta] virtue is their doner,

And chaetity -that timid flower,
Shn'nking from touch impure — the vice

Or all unknown, -0r death the price!
