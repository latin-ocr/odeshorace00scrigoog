our, xv1. OF HORACE. 97

Life’s bitters are by smiles suppress'ss
Since nothing is completely blest.
Death tam’d Achilles' youthful tage -
Decrepid Tithon bent with age -
And time, perehance‚ to me supplies
The blessings it to thee denies.

A hundred flocks adom thy ground,
Sicilian heifers low around3

ny neighing mare in ehariot flies3
Thy vesture gleams with Afrie's dyes3

While upon me unerring Fato
Has but bestow'd a §mall estate,

A spirit slight of Greeian song,
Which spurns the base malignam throng.
