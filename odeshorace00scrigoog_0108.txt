oms xm. OF HORACE.

Wouldst thou resign Lycimnia’s tress ,

The Persien's treasures to possess? '
Or Phrygia's rich Mygdonian store?
Or Arab tents replete with ore?

When she to burning kiss applies
Her neck, or-feigning eoy - denies
what, snatch’d by force, would better please,

- And she et times is first to seize.

ODE XIII.

Hs, who, Otree‚ with impious hand,
Wes first to plant thee in my land,
In evil hour - bane of his rece,

, Ι And all the neighbourhood's disgraee—
. His father’s aged neck would break,
Or blood of guest at midnight take.
