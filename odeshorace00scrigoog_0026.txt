om 1. OF nomon.

In the cold air the huntsm‘an’s fise,
—Unmindful of his hender wife, -

‘ f When flies the stag the hounds beere,
Or burste through toils the Marsian boat.

May ivy - learning’s prize -be inine,

And raise me to the gods divine3

„And shadowy groves exclude the throng
Where Satyrs danne the nympha among ;
If still resound Euterpe's strains,

Nor Polyhymnia’s hand disdains,

- Unhind -the Lesbian harp to grace:
But if your poet's name you place

With lyric bards, my head on high
Shall proudly atrike the statry sky.
