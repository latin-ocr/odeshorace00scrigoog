Oh l teueh me measures soft and sweet,

Which Lyde’s stubborn ears may greet3
Who - as a three-year filly -bounds
Along the extended pamm-ground&
And fiies - as yet unripe to wait

Τὴθ approaohes of an amorous mate.

Tigers and forests own thy sway3

The rapid streame thy powers delay3
nugo, cerberus, at Pluto’s hau,

Submitted to 'thy pleasing thmll;
Though-fieree-his head the monsber shakes‚
Infuriate with a thousand snakes3

And poison from his triple tongue

Pours its infected steam along3

While Tityus’‚ and Ixion’s face

soft smiles -- although reluctant- grace ;
And Danaus’ girls -enraptur’d-turn‚

Leaving awhile the empty urn.
