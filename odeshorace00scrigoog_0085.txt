ΤΟ ms SLAVE.

ΒοΥ, Ι deveat the Persian’s πωπω
The philyra-woven wreath I hate ;
Then eease to hunt where — hidden - blows
The floweret of the later rose. Ι

Α simple chaplet quick prepare ;
To·day the myrtle wreath I wear ;
Which, while Ι quaff beneath this vine,

shall grace thy master’s brow-and thine.
