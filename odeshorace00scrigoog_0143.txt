124 ODES ιιοοιι ιιι.

So, genuine velour - oneo repress'd -

Soorns to remount the eowerd’e breost.
When timid hind‚ relees’d from oneres,
Shell turn on the pursuers' speon,

Let Carthage dread the seoond blow
of him, who bent to faithless foe,
Who temely felt the lettere tie

His oreven arms, yet seer'd to die;
Who - to preserve his dasterd life-
Mingled inglorious peeoe with strife.
Ο shame! Ο Carthago, rais’d on high,
Great from Itelio’s infamy Ξ ”

He spoke3 - end, teinted by disgrooe,
Repuls’d his gentle wife's embraoe,

- His little sons 3-then‚ bending low
To eerth his stem, yet menly brev,

With oounsel ne'er before attoin'd

OEhe senete's wovering voice he gein’d3
