138 ODES noox‘m,

Let Lyde note, with ear intent,

The virgins’ crime, ond punishment3
How performed jam they fill,

- For ever pouring, empty still! «-

'Eternity pursuing crime,

Τὴθ murderous deods persorm’d in time!
Impious! - for where a greater guilt
Thon husbamd's blood by woman spilt ἳ-
One only worthily had borne

me nuptial moreh, -to her sire forsworn 3·-
Hlustrious, nobly·pe1fim'ddame!
Renown’d through every age thy fame!

“ Rise,” to her youthful lord she said,

“ Adeo, lest sloep's eterno] shade

Descend from umuspeetod ire;

Deeeive my sistere, and my sire.

- As lioness on the bull-oulf preys -

So emh olas! a husband slays3

But I-less fierco-no sword will stain,
Nor thee within these walls detain :
