. oon xxwm. OF HORAOE. 169

The sun descende tho noontido hill 3

And yet—as if tho day stood still-
From storo how slowly you produce

The oash, that dates from Bibulus!

Lot Neptune now inspiro our song,

And now tho green-hair'd Nere'id·throng;
Latona shall thy stringo inspiro,

And Cynthia’s dans awako thy lyre.
Sing lost the laughtor·loving queen

Of Cnidian bowers, and Paphian soene,
Whoso twin-yok’d swons booolm the sens,

· That wash the shining Cyclados:
Ι Thon let the mirthinspiring night

A song of grateful praise invite!
