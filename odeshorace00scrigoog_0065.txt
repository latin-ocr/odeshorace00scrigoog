46· ODES 1300ss 14

There the hot lust, and gross desire,
That set the mother-mares on lire,³

Asound your uleer'd liver fly,
And wake the vain, comphining sigh, j

That sprightly youth green ivy suits,
And verdent myrtle’s earliesfi shoots;
While wither’d branehes hard and ἀτχ -
To Eurus ded'ieated — die!

ODE XXVI.

ΤΟ AELIUS LAMJA.

Tne muses' fn'end-my grief and sear
I bid the wenton breezes bear,

And plunge them in the Creten eea.
Cerelessl-what matters it to me
who lords it at the frozen pole?

Why trembles Tiridatee' seul?
