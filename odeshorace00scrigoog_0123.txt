104 ODES Boon 11.

Thou, when the impieus band, on high,
Of giants seel’d thy father's sky,

. Hurl’dst Rhaetus back, with lion’s elaws,
-With lion's grim, terrific jawe -

Thou then, though more inclin'd, they say,

For (lances, sportive jests, and play,

— Unfit for savage war’s alarms -

Foremest in peace- wer't first in arms.

Cerberus thy golden horn confess'd,

'lhe menster’s teil his joy express'd3

His triple tongue‚ on thy retreat,

Licking -well pleas’d —thy legs and feet.
