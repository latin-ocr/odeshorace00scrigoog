Though first in rank Maecnian ¹Homer’e precise,
Who therefore dares contemn Pindaric lays?

The Cean Muse l -Alcaeue’ threatening arcius?—
Or who the bold Stesichorus disdaine?

Nor time can dim, nor fleeting years efface

The odes that bouet Anacreon’s sportivc grace}
Still breathes the love-etillburne the amorous fire
The AEclian maid intrueted to her, lyre.

Not she alone— the beauteoue Spartan dame—
Beheld the adulterer’s curls with lustful fleme,

The glittering vest, with gold embroidery seen,
The courtly retinuc- the kingly mien.

Not Teucer bent, alone, the Cretan bow,

Nor hae Idomeneus display'd his might,
Nor Sthenelus only won the Musc in fight3
Nor Hector, nor DelphobuS, the first

In rapid fury on the blttle burst,

Nor war, once only, laid an Ilion low; Ι

'Mid hottest strife still eager to secure
