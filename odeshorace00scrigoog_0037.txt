18 ODES mox 1.

Why hides he now -like Thais’ boy
Em smok'd the funeral-pyrea of Troy,
Lest- caught in manly garb -he go
To slaughter, and the Lyaian foe?

ODE IX. hs

ΤΟ THALIARGHUS.

Sar, with the deepening flakes, how white
Soracte stands t-ahe woodland height
Can scarae austar'n the weight of snow,

While iae-bound rivers aeaae to flow.

Dissolve the eold 2-with legs pil'd high
Now planteously tha fire supply ;
And from thy Sabine eaak produce

- Now four years old—the mellow'd juiee.
