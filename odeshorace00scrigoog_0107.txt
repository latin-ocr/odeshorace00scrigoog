'oms noox 11.

Nor Lapithae, of savage sllu13

— HylaeuS, revelling in the bowl -
Nor gistum, who Alcides fied,
When Saturn's palaee shook with dread.

Maecenas, thy historic prose
May better Caesar's wars disclose3
And how the necks of threatening kings

Along our ways Augustus bringS.

But me the Muse commands to tell
Lyeimnia’s songs, of dulcet swell3
The brilliant lustre of her eyeS‚
Her heart of saith to mutual ties3

How the light danee she loves lo try,
Or spol-t with jocund raillery ;
Or with the nymphs her arms to twine,

who grace Diana's sacred shrine.
