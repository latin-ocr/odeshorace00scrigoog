I’d doubt 110 more; but thou, instead,
Though pledging deep thy peljur’d head,
-As fair as false, and false es fair— .

Art still our youth’s engressing care.

And well it prospers, I believe,
Thy mother’s ashes ιο deceive,
The stare, that rule night's silent hours,

With heaven, and heaven's immortal powers.

Such broken osths ιο laughter move
Venus, the nymphs, and savage Leve,

who sharpens still his eruel darts

011 whetstone—ting’d with bleeding hearts.

Add that for thee our striplings grow,

- New slaves before thy charms ιο bow, —

'While former lovers haunt thy door,

Th0ugh threatening osteo love no more.
