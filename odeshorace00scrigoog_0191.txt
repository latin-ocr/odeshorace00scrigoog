And smiles, when mortal’s ¹anxious tear
Betrays too much a mortrh’e sear.

Give present sorrows present eare3

Τ1ιθ rest let time's deep river bear: ’
The tranquil stream now ealmly glides

On towards Etruria’e ocean-tides; ·’
Now-rapid-earriesin its fall η

Roeks, cattle, houses, mountain· —all3

As the fieree rrhirlpool’e roering flood

Re-eehoes through the neighbouring woed.
Happy the mortal who ean say,

Sincerely‚ “ I have liv’d te day 3

Nor care I if the approeehing mom

With sunehine or with clouds may ‘dawn ;”
Whate’er the aspect of w-morrow, ·

It cannot cloud to-day with sorrow ;

Nor ean misfortune’s withering bleet

Reeal or ehill the happy pest.
