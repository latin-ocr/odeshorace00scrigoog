78 opps

Weary with many a wandering far,

By sea and land, and tiffd of wan
Which, should the cruel Fates refuso,
Galesus' pastoral banks I'll ehoose,

- Fertile in fiocks — the fruitful shore

Spartan Phalanthus rul’d of yore'.

That nook of earth most sweetly smiles,

’ And— more than all- my heart beguileS‚

Whose honey with Hymettian hives,

Whose olive with Venafrum, strives ;

Where Jupiter a lengthen'd spring,

And winters mild is wont to bring3

And Aulon -fertile Baechus’ friend —

Wiss scarcely to Falernus bend. Ι
Theo - with thy hard - that place inviteS,
That happy spot! -those towering heights !—
There shall thy sprinkling tears attend

Τὴθ ashes of thy poet-friend.
