80 onns

Give then to Jove tho 16661 requir'd3

And -with the lengthen’d warfare tir’d -

Bonoath my laurel rest reolin’d,

Nor sparo the casks - for theo design'd.

Fill up oblivious Mansio well

In polish’d oups ;— from bounteous shell
Pour perfume forth. Who hastens now
Tho parsley-memb, or mynle·bough?
To whom shall Venus now assign

To give th‘e tonse, and pass the wine?
Not more than Thracian Thyad grave,
At friondship’s feast I love to rave.

ODE VIII.

ΤΟ BARINE.

ΗΑΒ punishment oveng’d e’er now,
Barim, any broken vow ; -

Hod but one oharm begun to fail,

By bloeken'd tooth or blemish'd 11611, -
