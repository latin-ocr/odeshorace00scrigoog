ODES mox 11. ⁴

Nor walth, nor oonsul's robes, control
The tumults of the wretchesl¹ s0u13

Those caree, which-ever-anxious-fly

Around the vaulted eanopy.

How frugally‚-h0w well he fares,
Whose board his father's salt-dish bears ;

Whose gentle slumbers have not fied
Through sordid avarice or dread!
Wherefore, when life so soon is o'er,
Attempt so much? - why the far shore,
By other suns illumin’d, try?

· What exile from himself can fly?
Care mounts the vessel's brazen sideS‚
Care amid troops of horsemen rides 3
Swift as the stag's retreating form,

Or Eurus-hurrying on the storm.
Τὴε mind, content with present state,
Oourts not a glimpse at future fate3 ¹
