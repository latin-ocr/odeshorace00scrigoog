ODE III.

TO MELPOMENE.

ΗΕ, whom the Muses, at his binh,
Welcom'd‚ with favouring glauce, to earth,
No victor's laurel·cr0wn shall claim,

— A wrestler from the Isthmian game : -

For him no rapid courser flies,

To bear away the Olympio prizeg

Nor, from the Capitolian height,

Shall erowds proclaim the conquering knight,
His brows with Delian wreath adorn'd‚

For monarchs quell'd‚ and menace scorn’d.
But Tiber's walam, as they glide

Along the river’s fertile side,

And leafy groves the bard shall praise‚ ·
Fam’d for his sweet AEolian lays,
