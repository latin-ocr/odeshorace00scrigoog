While thus the hawk pursues -οη high,

’Tis thus the gentle pigeons fly3
And thus the nimble hunter goes
On treck of hare through AEmon's snows.

She —- fir’d a nobler death to die -
The swerd beheld with fearless eye ;
Nor sought to gain, with rapid fleet,

Some hidden shore's secure retreat.

Daring - with eye serene and bold -
Her ruin'd palade to behold; ¹

Το handle the envenom’d snake,-
The poison in her heart to take.

As death approaeh’d, more br'ave she grew,
And seorn'd - with fieree Liburnian crew -
Το sail the deep -a captive queen!

To grace some proud triumphal scene.
