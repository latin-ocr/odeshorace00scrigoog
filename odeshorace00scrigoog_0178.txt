If any, anxious to assuage

Unholy sloughter’s civil ruge,

Would for himself o statue eloim,

— “The father of the etate,” his neme—
Let him — to efter-ages known -

¹Curb the wild lieenoe of his own ;

Since living virtues faintly bloom,

But nise - immortel -from the tomb.
But what avelle such sod lument,

While guilt escapes its punishment?
—Vain lawe, where morule ure unknown l—
Sinoe, nor the raging fiery zone,

Nor distant north, with snow-olud ground,

Narrows the busy merchant’s round.
The skilful euilor stems the seen,

And, fearlese breves the ocean-breeze3

While poverty - that dire disgreoel -
Still bids us every danger saee3
Eeoh toil-eeeh suffering to essuy, -

Deserting virtue's orduone way.
