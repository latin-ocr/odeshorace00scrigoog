ODE H. o]

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

Ewowen of grievous hail and snow
Hae Jove now pour’d on earth below,
Whose red right-hond our town appele,

’ And shekes the temple’s towering wells.

Tremblee the world lest Pyrrhe's reign
Rise, of new monsters to eomplm'n3

When Proteus' herde, on defige-tide,
Gamboll'd upon the mountain side 3

When fish on highest elms were seen,
Olinging where reoent deveo hod been;
And timid antlers — swimming - fied,

Thoe wetere bubbling o’er the hoo
