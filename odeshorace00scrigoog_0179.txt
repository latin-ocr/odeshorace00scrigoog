160 'onos

Let us to Capitolion height,

Whither the applauding orowds invite,
Or in the billows‚ raging neor,

Cast ull our gemo, ond glittering goar:
There too our useless gold we'll throw,
- Material foul of heaviost woe-
Wouldst thou repent each sordid vioe?
Uproot the seeds of ovan'oe:

Let mindo, of too effeminate mould‚
Grow, by severer studies, bold.

Sooroe knows our noble youth the paee
of the proud stood, -but foere the chaoe;

More skill'd the Greoian troque to ply‚
Or oport with law-forbidden die.
The perjur'd falsehoods of the siro

Against hio deerest truste conspire,

Hostening a fortune to prepare,
- Amass’d for his unworthy heir:-
But, though his ill-got hoards increase,

Some nameless want still mars his peace.
