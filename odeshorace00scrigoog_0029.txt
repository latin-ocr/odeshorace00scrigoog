ODES ‘ Boon 1. γ

To whom shall Jove assign the fate
The crimes of Rome to expiate?
Prophetic Phoebus, vome, we pray‚

Enrob'd in clouds - thy bright array! -

Or, Venus, with thy rosy smile,

Whom Mirth and Love attend the while ;
Or thou-our founder— turn thy face
011 thy neglected sons and race,

Tir’d with thy sport-too long, alas 1-
Whom shouts delight, and helms of brass'‚
And Moorish soldiery, whose eyes

Gloat on the foeman, as he dies:

Or if, fair Maia’s son, thy wing‚
And alter'd form a youth should bring,
Content on earth with mortal fame,

-- Gaesar’s avenger for thy name, -·
