ont xv1. OF HORAOE. Ι 33

To our first clay Prometheus brought
A particle, from all eides sought;
And of the lion's rege e part

. „Implanted in the human heert. Ι

Rege caused ssyestes’ femtul fall ;
Through rege the loftiest eity'e wall, ¹

- crameled in utter ruin low --
Has felt the ploughshere of the foe.

Then calm thy wrath :— mg) fervid breast,
In pleasing youth, like rege postess’d3
Which urg'd me, passionate„ along,

’ To scribet that Iambic song.

’ From greve to gay my theme shall change,
With thee in friendship’s ties to range ε

Thou shalt my former mind restore,

And I-reeent, and write no more!
