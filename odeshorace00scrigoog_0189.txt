ODE XXIX.

ΤΟ MAEcENAs.

Solon of proud Tynhenian kings‚

See what thy favourite poet brings3
Generous wine from ehoioest store,

For thee reserv'd- untapp'd before!
Rom-leave& and ointment press'd with care,

Maecenas, to adom thy hair.

Come, delay not 3- stay no more

Τρ gaze on Tibur's humid shore3

On AEsula— those acres won

By parricidal Telegon 3 -

Fly the rich feast —the buildings high,
Whose towering columns touch the sky ;

Fly from the splendour of thy home,

The smoke- the wealth—the noise of R0m0;
