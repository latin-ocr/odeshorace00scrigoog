ODE IX.

l
no mm]

Honncn.
Wffinsn I was welcome still to thoe,
Nor any youth - preferr'd to me -
Round thy white neck his arms might fling,
I liv’d - more hlest than Persia’s king.

Lnnu.

Whilst thino no other- warmer flame -
Nor Lydia after chlo& came,

Thy Lydia then to fame had grown,
-More thnn the Roman 'nia known.

Honncn
'lhe Thracian chloe· rules me now5
Skill’d in the lyre's melodious fi0w;
For whom I'd die ;—w0nld Fate but save

Her soul - surviving -from the grave.
