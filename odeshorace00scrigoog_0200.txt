My voioe its tribute then shall bring,

-If ought I worthily may sing --
“ 0 blest, 0 lauded day,” my otwin,
ἵ “ Which brings Augustus home again ! ”

‘⁴ Io triumphe !” be our song,

Repeated, ae we move along:

And frankinoense- in plenty strew'd -—
' Shall prove to heaven our gratitudo.

For thee ten bulls - ten heifers bleed -
My vows a tendor steerling need,

ὀ Which now without its mother stre-ys,
And in the fattening pasture plays ι

Like the young moon his bending horus,
When her third rising feebly dawns;
His brow displays a spot like snow„
A dun his limbo and body show.
