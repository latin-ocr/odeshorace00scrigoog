ont v1. OF HORAOE.

“ Far more belov'd than Pholo& coy,
Or Chloris, ·or the Cnidian boy,
Gyges -with ivory shoulder bright,

-Like moonbeams 011 the wave at night.

With thronging nymphs on either side,
Who shall fair Gyges’ sex decide?
The girlish look — the girlish look -
Might well the skilful stranger mock.

ODE VL

TO SEPTIMIUS.

Simuos, who with me wouldst fly

Τρ Spain -the unconquer'd Cantabri - ⁸
Or barbarous Synes’ sandy soil,

Where Mauritaniam waters boil;

Sweet Tibur's shores- when old — I’ll seek‚

First coloniae& by roving Greek,
