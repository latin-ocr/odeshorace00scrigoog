Το my safcty a hundred deep humpers youU take,
And bid the lamps wswh, till the mom is swske.

¹ Far —fsr be all clumour, and unger unkind;

And the cures of the city dismiss from your mind
Now Cotison’s army from Dacia is foil’d,

And the Mede in a war with himself is embroil’d3
The Spanish Cantabrian serves us st last,

Whosc chain - though not easy to rivet -is fast .;
The Scythicus on quitting the field arc intent,

Their courage is cool'd, und their bows are nubent.-

Thcn anxious uo more how the populace fare,
Bid aduc tc the office, snd summan-like cure,
But joyfully scize 011 the boons of toucy,

And ..like mc-drivc all serious business away.
