ODE XVI.

ΤΟ TYNDARIS.

Ο, Tm fair mother fairer still,
Put to whatever end you will
Those slanderous lines, compos'd by me,

Or in the flame or Adria's sea.

Not Cybele so the bosom fireS,
Nor priests the Pythian god inspirae,

Not BacchuS, as his votaries pass,
Nor Corybantes’ sounding braSS,

As direful rage3 — which wrecking main,
Nor Noric weapons can restrain3
Nor furious flame, nor mighty Jove

- Terrfflc, thundering from above.
