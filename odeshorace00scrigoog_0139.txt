obss soon m.

Great Jove 1 who rules, with equol hand,
The windy woves and massive land,
Cities, and Pluto's gloomy reign,
Imm0rtal gods, and mortal men.

That horrid youth - their trust their arms -
Shook Jove himself with fieroe slarms3

— The brothers -who the Olympian shode
With lofty Pelion would invade.

What oould Typhoeus? - Mimss' might ? —
Porphyrion what, with threst'ning height? —
Or what oould Rhoetus, giant-born ἓ -
Enceladus, dorting trees uptorn? - Ι

- All rushing on Minerva's shield 1 -
Here Vulean reges for the field ς

Here J uno stenem and he whose ouiver.
And bow hang st his shoulder ever.
