ODE IL

ΤΟ C. CRISPUS SALLUSTIUS.

Ssuhusu, thou enemy to gold,
Which niggard mines in darkness hold,
No lustro do our tressures show,

Unless with temperate use they glow.

Long years shall Proculeius share,
A brother- with a father's care —
With wing untir'd‚ surviving Fame
shall hear aloft his deathless name.

Thou reign'st- thy avafioe once subdu’d -

Farther than should thy power include
Libya, with Gades distant bay,
And either Carthage own’d thy sway.
