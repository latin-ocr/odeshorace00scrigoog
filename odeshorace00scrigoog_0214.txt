ODE VII.

so sommus.

Tmssnows disselve3-f1esh culture clothes the plain,
And budding foliage gems the boughs egein3

Earth’s varied fase the changing seasons show,

And lessening streems through verdent margins flow:

With sistere twein the grece, end nymphe advance,

ι And -nsked - dere τό lead the jocund denes.

The year - the hour which steals the joyous day,

ι Forbids our mortal hopes too far to strey.

The zephyrs mild dispel the wintry blest3
Summer succeeds to spring ; -- to fiis es fest,

When fruitful autumn its abundenee reers;

¹ And lo! the sluggish winter reappeersl
