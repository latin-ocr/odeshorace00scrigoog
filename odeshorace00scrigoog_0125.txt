106 ODES noorl 11.

Swifter than Icarus shall I soar,

To visit Bosphorus’ murmuring ehore3 ’
Gaetulian Syrtes shall I gain,

And try the Hyperborean plain,

- A bird of eweet melodious strain. -

Colchions ond Dacians, who oonoeel
From Mareian troops the sear they feel,
With wild Geloni—fer remote, -

Shell me —- their favourile poet -quote3
Alike by learned Spaniard known,

And him who dnnlrs the rapid Rhene.
No dirge my empty tomb profane,

— Indeeent grief, or mournful strein -
Suppress your funeral-ories, ond save

The needlese honours of the grove.
