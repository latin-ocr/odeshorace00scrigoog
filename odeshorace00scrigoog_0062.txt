one xxxv. oe nomen? 43

No lion I-nor tiger grim-

Pursue to tear eaeh tender limb;

Quit then at length thy mother’s side—
Alreedy ripe to be a bride.

ODE XXIV.

ΤΟ VIRGIL.

Wm· bounds impose to grief ?-why blush with
sheme

At fond affection for so deer e neme?¹

Thy saddest strein, Melpomene, inspire,

With liquid voice, end eweet'paternal lym. . 1

Does then perpetual sleep Quinctilius bimi?
Ah! where shall modesty his equel find?

Where stainless faie, with sister-justice near?

Where neked truth -who seems disguise or sear?
