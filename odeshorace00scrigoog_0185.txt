“ Do Ι- awake — my crime deplere?
Or, flying from the ivory door,

Does some vain phantom coin the dream,
When - guiltless still -I guilty seem?

“ Why- why through boundless oceane roem?
Why quit the flowery meads of home?
« Oh! were this monster near, to feel

The wreth of my avenging steel!

“ Oh! might these hands but rend in spite
Those horns - so lately my delight 1-
Shameless- from father’s house Ι stmy ς

Shameless — my doom I yet delay.

‘⁴ Oh! if the immort'els hear my prayer,
Might I with lions wander-bare—
Before my comely cheeks deeay,

And moisture leaves its tender prey!
