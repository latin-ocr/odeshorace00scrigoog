And Rome -still fieroe in werlike deeds-
Impose its lews on conquer’d Medos ;

- still dreadful - lether name extend
To where earth's distant boundsries end;
Where the mid-ocean, with its tides,

Europe from Africa divides3
Or where the swollen Nilus yields

Its fertile flood to Egypt's fields;
Braver, despieing gold, - unfound -

Thus better pleeed- in secret ground-
Then if exhum'd for men it oeme,
Profaning every secred name.

To worlds that dere resist thy swey

Thy troops shall bend their willing way3
Whether wild raging fires are there,

Or clouds and rein o'eroharge the air.

Such fate for warlike Rome I tell,

While Rome observes this caution well3
