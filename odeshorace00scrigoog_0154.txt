one x. OF HORAOE. 135

ODE X.

mo ‘mee

Leon, for thee if Scythien Teneie pour’d

Its distant eneam -some sevage men thy lord-
Stil] might thy emorous swain compassion find,
-Streteh’d et thy door, and freezing in the wind.-
Hark ! how the hinges ezeek 1 —the tasteful trees,
The grace thy mansion, whistle in the breeze 3-
See how the settled snow, with eold intense,

Is glaz’d by Jove’s congeeling influenee 1

Lay then thy haughty insolenee aeide,

Lest Venus punish thy offending pride3

Lest every eham, in enger'd haste, she steal‚

- Swift es the loosen'd iepe revolves the wheel ε -

Not Lyce, glowing werm with 'Pescen blood,
should feign Penelope's relentless moed.
