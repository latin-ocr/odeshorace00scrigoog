The theatre’s eppleuees woo'd
Tne banks of thy paterne] flood3
While spontive echo bore thy preise

To Vaticanus’ mountain-ways.

Thee Caeeuben may better pleese,
Or grepe Celenien presses squeeze3
But Formian, or Falernian wine

Diedeins such hemely eups es mine. ἵ

ODE XXI.

Sme, tender maida, Diena’s neme3
Sing, boys, Apollo'e youthsul feme;
Latona sing, to whom great Jove
Breeth'd forth his mighty seul in love.

Sing her, who seeks the stream and shede
On chiny mgnum nspnf'n,
In Erymanthus' woodlend scene, ,

Or Cragus rob'd 111 nature’s purest green.
