one rv. OF HORACE.

At length perfidious Hannibal might say,

“Like timid stage, of ravening volves the prey‚
We - wilhng -follow now the conquering host3
Το soil, or fly them were our proudest boast!

That ration, which, from Ilion's raging fleme,

Of old, to sweet Ausonie's sities eame;

successful still - though toss'd on Tuseen vave-—
Their gods -their sons -their aged sires to seve!
So the lopp'd oak' from woodman’s cruel wound,

In Algidum, where darkening shades abeund,

Still every loss -- still every blow survives - .

,And strength and vigour from the steel derives,

. Not more did Hydra on Alcides gain,

—Strong from its maims end scorning to be
elain-
Nor Echionian Thebes nor Colchian shere

Produe’d e monster to be dreeded more. A

Sink - einh it deep, a fairer form it shows ;

Contest the palm, its valour overthrows
