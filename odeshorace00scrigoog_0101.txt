82 ODES noon 11.

Thee for their b'oys our mothers dread,

Thee thnfty age and maidens wed,

-- New brides - who tremble lest thy charms
Should lure their husbands from their arms.

ODE IX.

ΤΟ VALGIUS.

Sflownns will not adwayS, Valgius, flow,
Meistening the furrow’d fields below3
Nor always will the uncertain stonn
The Caspian’s crystnl naves desorm; Ι
Nor glaciers for ever stand

— Unmelted —in the Annenian land ; 2
Nor Gargan oaks the north enrnge‚ }

Widowing the ash of scatter’d foliage.

But you of Mystes’ loss complain,

In endless themes of mournful strain;
