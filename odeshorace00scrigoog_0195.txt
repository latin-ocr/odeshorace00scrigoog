ODES roos ιν.

And wouldst thou pieree a fitter heart,
Let Paulus' tender bosom smart3

A noble, and a eomely youth,

Who pleads the anxious cause of truth!
He, of each gentle art the pride,

Thy myrtle-wreaths shall scatter wide3
And when—in simple eharms —he smiles
At wealthier rivals’ fruitless guiles,

Thy statue, near the Alban stream,

Hell guard with many a eitron bearn.
There shall the fragrant incense ries,
While soothing strains the lyre supplies,
-Mingling with Berecynthian flute- s
Nor is the reed-—harmonieus — mute.

There twice a day the youths shall raise

l
l

- With tender maids -thy votive praise3
And thrice -like Salian priests-shall best
The jocund earth with shining feet.
