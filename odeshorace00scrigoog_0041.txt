ODE XII.

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS.

WHAT man, what hero shall'thy lyre,

- What god ?-thy pieming flute inspire?
Say, Clio, whose immortal name

Shall Echo- viewless nymph -proelaim

Whence woods and groves to Orpheus’ song
Hurried promiscuously along 3

Who, by maternal art, eonfin'd

The rapid stremnS, and winged wind ς
