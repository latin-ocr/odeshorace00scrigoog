“ Let wrath no more, nor passion burn3

This hated bull shall yet return,
And offer the offending horn,

By thee -revengeful-to be torn.

“ Know thyself now the thunderer's bride ;
Unworthy wailings lay aside3

Leam to endure thy brilliant fame,

Since half the globo shall bear thy name.n

ODE XXVIII.

WHAT better plan for Neptune’s day?
Come, lively Lyde„ bring, Ipray,

Old Caecuban ; and strike-strike hard -
At Wisdom -ever on her guard!
