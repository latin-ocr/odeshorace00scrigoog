ODES Boon 1.

One seeks -of three-sold honours proud-
The favour of Rome’s fiokle crowd ;
Another in his stores would hide

Whote’er the Libyan berne provide ς

A third, who ploughs the ancestral plain„
Attalus’ wealth would templ in vain

Upon Myrtoan waves to float,

-Α snilor, mered, in Cyprian boet. -

The merchant, dreeding Afrio’s breezo,
While struggling with Ioorion sees,

Though leuding then the leisure eweet

of his own rural town's retreat,

His shalter’d berk will soon repen,
—Want’s pinching streits unteught to bear. -
This man the ancient Maesio poure,

And ohoats the lingering noontide hours,
Where Anbutus her shade supplies,

And founts of secred wetere rise.

Some love the comp, end martial stete,

Trumpete end ware —the mothers’ hate.
