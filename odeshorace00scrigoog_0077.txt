ODES

Me, when superior beeuty woo’d‚

The slave-born Mynale subdued ; -
Though rough es Adrie’s foeming eprey,
Which eurls eround Celebrie’e bey,

She woke the lover’s pleesing pain,-

She forg'd the lover's weleome chain.

ODE XXXIVJ

ΙΝ sophist·mednees while I strey'd,

Seldom end negligent I pray’d ;

But now I hehe e different teek,

And steer my home-bound vessel beck.
For Jove, who, with the lightning's dart,
Is went the derkening clouds to pert,

Os lete in repid eer was seen,

Thuedering aeross the blue serene3

Lo! ponderoue earth-the repid tides -
The murky gloom whieh Taenarus hides-
