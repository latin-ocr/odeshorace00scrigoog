ODE XXV.

ΤΟ LYDIA.

'T1s seldom now that saucy beaux

Your windows shake with amorous blows;
And now - while undisturb’d you sleep -
Your door its threshold loves to keep.

How easy once those hinges play’d!
Less frequent now the serenade,

“ Can slumber close my Lydia’s eyes,
While the &my niqht her lover dies ?'’

Of seomful makes, in narrow lane, «-
Old and neglected, -you compluinz
Encounten'ng Thracian broezes keen,

While not a glimpse of moon is soen.
