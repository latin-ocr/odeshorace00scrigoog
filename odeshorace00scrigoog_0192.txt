Ι ons xm. Oh* HORACE. 173

Fortune - who loves her eruel trade -
Pointing how faithless honours fade—
Her wauton geme persists to play,

- Thy friend t0·m0rr0w, mine to-dey!
Ipralse her when her gift she brings ;
But, if she spreads her repid wings
That gift Ι willingly resign,

Esteeming nought, but virtue, mine ;
While honest poverty I claim,
Unpension'd by the fickle dame.

Ι When winds end waves ere raging high,

Te eoward prayer Iseorn to fly;

Nor offer useless vows te seve

My treesure from the thirsty weve.
Then blithely L perehance, shall fleat
Sese in my little two-oer’d boat-
By Pollux and the favomlng breeze
Wafted across the AEgean sees.
