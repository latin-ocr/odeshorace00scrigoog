But still by learning genius is refin'd‚

And strengthening discipline improvos the mind ;
Where absent morals yield their vaoant place,
Vioes and crimes our natural good disgraoe.

What you, Ο Rome, to conquering Neros owe,
Metaurus’ stream and vanquish’d Canhoge show,
And that propitious day to Latium's shore,

When darkness held its hated reign no more ;
With vietory's smila its early dawning glow’d‚

— What time through Latian towns tha Libyan

rode-

So flame through pino-troes-—kindiing from the 3

breeze -
So Eurus riots in Sieilian seas.
Henoesorth the Roman name was doom’d to risa,
-Their youth adorn’d with prosperous enterprise-
And temples, wasted by the Punic swerd,
Boasted their shrines—their sculptur’d gods re·

stored.—
