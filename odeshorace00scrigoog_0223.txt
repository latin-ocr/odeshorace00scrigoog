204 omes

Now thirsts for the empurpled flood
Of votive lambs’ besprinkled blood3 —

All - all is bustle, haste, end noise3

Here run the mingling girls and boys;

Now high the trembling flames are seen,
The derkening emoke ascende between.
But wouldst thou know the sweet delights,

Phyllis, to which thy hard invites?

Thou’rt ask’d to celebrate the ides,
— The day which April’s month divides -
April ἔ which see-born Venus claime,

Devoted to voluptuous gemes!

This day inspires with sacred mirth,
Far more than that whieh gave me bhwh3

Since first on this auspicious morn
My own Maeeenas hail’d the dawn.
