ona η. 01* nomon. 125

And-deas to weeping friends’ lament —
Hasted vo glorious banishment :

Th0ugh knowing well the fate he dar'd
Barban'an torture had prepar'd3

He put aeide, with gentle force,

Τὴο kindred crowd, that eheck'd his course3
As when -the tedious lawsuit done-
Through client-crowd he wander’d on,
Amid Venafran groves to stray,

Or by Tarentum's Spartan bay.

ODE VI.

TO THE ROMANS.

Rom —though guiltless — thine the fate
Thy fathers' crimes to expiate;

Till shrineS, rebuilt‚ adom thy plains,

And smoke no more the god profanes.
