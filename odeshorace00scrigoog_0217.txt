198 ODES uoox nv.

To no such gifts my means aspiro,

N or you suoh rerities require3

But verse delights, and verse I sing,
And point the price of what I bring.
Not busts, by whose immortal lines

- Restor’d to life - the hero shines,
Nor Hannibal, retreating foil’d,
Whose threats upon himself recoil’d,
Not Carthago, ’mid devouring fleme,
Wider extends his proise— his fame -
Sumam’d from Asrio’s oonque1²d plain,
Than sweet Csiobiieu Muses’ strein.
Oh! should you hush your poet's lays,

Who —who should sing your hero's pruise'?
Or what were Murs' eud Ilia’s pride,
Should silence great Quirinus hide?

AEsous, snatoh'd from Stygian waves,

The poet’s foveming influonce sevos 3

And - sacred in poetic song -

He rules the blissful isles among.
