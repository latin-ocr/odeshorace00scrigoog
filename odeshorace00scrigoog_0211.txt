. ODE VI.

TO APOLLO.

GREAr god, whose bow, in anger strung,
Aveng'd proud Niobe’s boastful tongue,
Punish'd lewd Tityus’ lustful fleme,

Α And Troy’s victorious foe could tame,

Brevest of Greeks -yet less than thee,
Though Thetis own’d her progeny 3
Before whose proudly·brandish’d spear
The Darden turrets ehook with sear:
He- as opine by woodman’s blow,
Or cypress leid by Eurus low -

Falls wide along the extended plain,
Whom Trojan mud and dust distein.
Not he, enclos'd with lying crowd,

In horse -to Pallas falsely vow'd -
