onn w, OF HORACE.

Castalian den-drops geni his hain
The Lysian graves confess his esre ;

His native woods Apollo sing,
Of Patara end of Delos king.

Untutor’d force — with bulk too great-

Falls by its own unwieldy weight 3

While Jove, whom wauton force offends‚
Our well-directed strength extends.

Witness of this, 'see Gyges stands,
conspicuous for his hundred hands ;
Orion, slain by virgin dart,

- 'sempter of Dien’s virgin henrt.

Heap’d o'er her monsters, Terreiies,
And grieves for every boli thet flies3
Hurling to heu her offspring dire:
Lo! AEtna— uneonsum’d by fire Ξ
