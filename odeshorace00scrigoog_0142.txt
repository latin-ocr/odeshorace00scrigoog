oni v. on fiennon. 123

While Jove end Rome still safety find?—
Spurning such crimes, the thoughtful mind
Of Regulus with seorn disdain'd

To sanction terme by beseness stein’d3

- A foul example of disgrace,
Thebane oi every future rece ;—

Unless our youth in dungeon gloom

- Unpitied - meet the eaptive’s doom.

“ I’ve seen,” said he, “ our standands fly

In Carthaginien temples high ;

Weapons from soldiers snatch’d- undy'd-
- Their freeborn arms behind them tied -
The Punic gates unclos'd‚ and ferme
Retill’d - once ravag’d by our arms:

But will the ransom’d soldier come

Braver or better to his home?

Loss end disgraee ! - the wool we stain

Shall ne'er its snowy hue regain 3
