But - sffim-uke- our daneing feet

The buoyant earth shall -- cemelese - beat.
Norshnllfair Damffismfipsy soull-
Deeper than Bassus dmin the bowl.

The banquet grace with rose-fiower leaf,
With pvtsley green, and lilios brief ς

anh gloating eye on Damilis turns:

she for her new-found lover burns3

Round whom the wauton arm she flings,
And closer than the ivy clings.

And now the Salian dafnties place,

Fit the immortals' eoueh to grace.
