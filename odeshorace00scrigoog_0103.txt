ΤΟ LICINIUS.

Tm· safer course, Licinius, keep,

Not always venturing on the deep,

Nor— cautious of the tempest's roar ὲ-

Pressing too much the treacherous shore.

who loves and woos the golden mean

Secure from sordid house is seen,
From squelid roos and ruin’d walls, X&
Not less then envy-moving halle.

The wind assails the lostiest pine ; -
High towers with heaviest fall decline ; έ-
And mountain pem, that soar to heaven,
First by the lightning-flash are riven.
