one vn. ou Houucu. 129

To Oricum, by Notus driven,
— The raging goat-stur high in heaven ;--

of thee he dremne on bede of snow
- The teare congeuling as they flou.—

His amorous hostess sends to tell
How Chloe' loves her guest too well3 ¹

' How all thy fires within her blaze
And tempts him in a thousand ways ;

Tells him a peljur’d women wove

'lhe wicked lie, which Proetus drove
- Credulous -the death to hasten-on
Of the too chaste Belleroph0n;

How Peleus risk'd his vhtuous life,

When - chaste —he fied Aeastus’ wife 3
Teaehing him other taleS, that win

Τὴθ listening stripling on to sin.
