om xm. oh nomen. 171

For pleaeing change, the weelthy share
'lheir poorer neighbour’s cottege·fare;
And throw eside the pomp of gloom‚
In little, snug, uneurtain'd room.

Now burning Cepheus mounts the sky,
Now Procyon’s beeme are raging high 3
While angry Leo’s fiery rays

Proelaim the drought of summer days.
'lhe shepherds, with their panting care,
To the dark river’e shede repair3
sitting beneath the shadowy bough,
Whose leaves the wind disturbs not now.
But still my patron’s cares arise

For Rome, end Rome’s high destinieS,
For troublous Tanais, and Cethay,

And Bactria, owning Cyrus’ swey.

Great Jove in night prefers to hide

Whete'er the future may betide3
