How in my wondering mood I love

The rook obrupt - the silent grove -
Greot deity! whose powerful swey

Notans, ond Baeohnnols'obey,

Whoee hands the uprooted neh o'erthrow l -
Now nothing little, nothing low, ¹
Nothing mortnl I recite;

Danger fills me with delight,

Booohus, while with thee I twine

The reokless brow with vendant vine.

Campaign of no inglorious stiife!
But now my arms end war-tiffd string

To Venus' eastern wall I bring ;
