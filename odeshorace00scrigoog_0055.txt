ODE XVIII.

ΤΟ VARUS.

Vinus, the sacred vine best pays thy toil

Near Catilus’ walls, and Tibur’s mellow soil.
For sober wights what hnrdshIps Jove prepares ἱ

Wine -wine alone dispels our biting canes. 1
By wine inspir'd‚ who rnils ai want or war?

Who sings not Venus’ ohanne, and Banehus’ car? ἰ
But se‘e- lest moderato orgies we exoeed -

Where dmnken Lapithae, and Centaurs blood.
Thus angny Bnoehus taught the Thracian throng‚ i

Whose greedy lust eonfounded right with wrong.

Not then— unwilling- BacchuS, will Ι rouse, i

Nor rites reveni, conceal’d by various boughs. 'i
