ODE XX.

TO MAEOENAS.

No mean - no oommon wing shall bear
The two-form’d poet through the air;
Nor longer doom’d on earth to stay,
Will I 'mid envious towns delay.

Not I- not I-who, some proclaim,

From blood of pauper parents came,
Sholl, lov’d Maecenos, breathe my last,

Nor Stygian waves detain mo fast.

Rough skin invades my legs below 3—
A snowy bird I upwards grow 3·-

My shoulders and my hands assume

The down of cygnet's softest plume.
