ODE VIII.

TO O. MARTIUS CENSORINUS.

Mn Censorinus, Ι would send

A burnish'd bowl to every friend ;

Or mpod, that of voIour speaks,

- 'Ibe guerdon of oourogeous Greeks!
Nor thee the poorest gift should bless‚
Did I those works of art possess,
Which from the Ephesion Scopas came,
Or boost Pannhosius' ancient name 3
This, skill’d to corve the Parion stone,
Thon, for his lnimio penoil known ;

Or if the Immortal gods they traco,

Or hero's sooroe less godliko face.
o 3
