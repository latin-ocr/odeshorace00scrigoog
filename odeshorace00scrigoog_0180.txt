ODE XXV.

ΤΟ BACGHUS.

Ser, whither urge me, god of wine,
O’erflowing now with thee end thino?
Where shall my mind’s unwonted fire

To hidden shedes or groves retire?

What eoves shall hear me meditate

On Caesor's proud, immortal stote,

High in the stmy reelms above,

- The oouneil-seat of thundering Jove ,7-
Sublime end new my verse shall flow,

- Unheerd before- unsung till now.

Booohente thus, with sleepless eyes,
Sterts -beholding with surprise

Hebrus, and Thraee’s snowy seat,

And Rhodope, trod by besberous feet.
