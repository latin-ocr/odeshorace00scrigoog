62 ODES Βοοι 1.

What sacred shrines, what altam have we spar'd?
Oh ἔ on new anvils be those swords prepar'd-

Blunted so long l-now doom’d to point* the blow
At distant Scythia, and our Amb foe!

ODE XXXVI.

Hn’HER the plenteous incense bring;

strike ... atrike the lyre’s melodious string ς
Let heifers’ votive blood be pour'd3 -

The gods have Numida restor'd 1

He from Hesperia’s distant skies

To ffiendship's eager welcome flies3
Though still his warmest love extends

To Lamia- earliest of his friends:
Under one rulo the schoolboys rang’d‚
One year behold their togas ohang’d.

A Cretan mark the day shall grace,
While to our cups no bounds we place3
