ona xn. or Horror. 207

The seoson, virgil, now to thirsi inclines:
But wouldstrthou torte our best Gelonion wineo
Thou,= who yvith noble youths art rront to dine,

Muet bring thy spikerrord here to earn thy wine:

A little box of nard the borrel boys,
Which now in sofe Sulpicion storehouse lies;
Wine, which oon all our warmest hopes improve,

And all the bitiemess of cere remove!

If with such joys thy willing heart oompher,

Approaeh with speed-and bring thy merchan-
dise 1-

Ι oan’t invite thee - gratis — to the treet,

- Like o rich noble, in his well-stor’d seat.

Thon banish all deley, ond goin's desire,
And- mindful of the dismal funeral-pyre-
Mix follies brief with wisdom’s sterner rule,

'Tis sweet - 'tis sweet at times to play the fool!
