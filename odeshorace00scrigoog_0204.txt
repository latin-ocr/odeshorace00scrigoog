onmv. or Horror. ι 185

- Driven from the dug, hie tawny dem’s supply -
Fcere by the monsters half-grown tccth to die :

s0 hcvmrerc,anr'chaecb01r‚ - ·
Drusus in anne, beneath the Alps, behold.

But whence their cusiom came, through many a γεω,
In the right hand the Amazon-axe to bear,

Not yet the bard heth ventuffd to explore;

(For who cen fathom learning's various store ἲ)-
Those bande - so long victorious in the field -
To youthful counsels forc'd at length to yield,
Perceiv'd what mind- what genius could effect,
Which sostering care and favouring roof protect ; ι

What Oaesars love, which Nero's children share,

Who own the father's in the monarch’s care.

Breve from the breve—from good the good de-
scende—

The steer and steed their sire's rencwn attende ;

, Nor may the proud, ferocious bird of Jove

Beget the gentle end unwarlike dove.
