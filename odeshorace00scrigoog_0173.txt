Whetever be the favour'd neme

Thy chosen Maesio juiee may cleim3 ⁴
Well vvorthy thy empurpled store

Upon some festal morn to pour,

Descend — Corvinus comesto dine,

And bide me dravv my mellowest wine.

Though quaffing deep Socratic lore,

He does not- stern -reject thy store;

For e'en the ancient Cato’e soul

Oft wenn’d her virtue in the bowl.

Thy violent, but pleesing sway
Drives every gloomy cere away:
Thou end the jolly god reveol
Counsele‚ and cares the wise conceal.
Vigour end hope 'tis thine to give —
. To bid the poor men boldly live;
Who‚ when the god his bosom warns,

Nor monarch fcere, nor wer’s alarme.
