om: 1. OF HORACE. 1⁷7

But me nor woman fair, nor boy,
Nor the fond hope of mutual joy,
Nor wine’s contention pleases n0w;

Nor with fresh flowers to bind my brow.

But why, ah! Ligurinus, why
Do team at times bedew mine eye?

why ‘does my fluent tongue refuso

Its wonQed eloquence to use?

oft at the midnight hour I seem

To clasp thee in the iflusive dream,

To chase thee flying 0’er the Campus wide,
Or - cruel - gliding 0’er the rolling tide.
