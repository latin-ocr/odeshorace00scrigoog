om: xm. oF nomen. 141

Whose shooting horns his vigour prove,
Portentous both of fight and love:
In vain, alas! — thy limpid stream shall pour,
Empurpled deeply with the wanton’s gore.

The raging dog-star’s fiery beam,

Ι - Harmless- descends upon thy stream3
- To thee the unyok’d oxen fly,

And wandering flocks thy coolness try:
Of noblest fountains shalt thou be,

Since Flaccus sings thy oaken tree,

Whose pleasing shade 0’erhangs the rocky cave, ⁵

Whenee -bounding - leaps thy babbling crystal

ane.
