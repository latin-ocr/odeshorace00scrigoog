112 ODES 110οι 111.

Through paths untn'od is wont to bear,

And wing them, havenward, through the εἰη ι
Scorning ’mid vulgar crowds to light,

She spurrrs the ground with rapid ssight.

True silence a reward invitem

Who blazons Ceres’ sacred rioes

shall ne'er with me in house abido,

Nor tempt, in fragile bark, thetide ε

For Jove- neglected - oft will strike

Guilty and guiltless both alike3

Since vengeance— though deferr’d the time-
Rarely forgets the by-gone crime.

ODE ΠΙ.

Tm: just - of firm unbending soul—

Nor overhearing crowd’s control,
Nor tyrant’s brow‚ in anger bent,
Can shake from his eonfirm'd intent3
