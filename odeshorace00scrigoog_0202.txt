The sons of Romo -tho towery queen,
Wido ruling o’er Italia's soene —
Have wroath'd with boys their poet’s brow,

Whom onvious malioo harms not now.

Pierian Mose, attuning well

Tho concord of tho gilded shell,

2 Who to mute fishes oouldst deoree ’
The swan’s expiring melody,
Thy giftit 18, that all admire
The bard who tunes 1118 Roman lyre3
By thoe I 111881118- andis it be

My numbers pleaso - ohey please by theo.
