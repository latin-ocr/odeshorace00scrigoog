om xm. OF HORAGE.

I burn, -or if those shoulders fair
The marks of drunken revel bean
Or on thy lip the fiery youth
Imprints his eruel, wauton tooth.
Ah 1 dream nothe shall oonstant prove,
Who wounds that rosy bower of love,
Where every kiss that parts the lips

In nectar’s own quintessenoe dips.

Thrioe and more happy they, whose minds'

Indjssoluble union binds 1
Whose love-⁶· untorn by evil strife -“
Lasts to the lavost hour of lise!
