ODES

ΤΙιο cattle sport along the plain,
To hail December's nones again ;

The festive village rocms the lea,

With cxen — now from labour free ;

While lambs - unscar'd —the wolf espy ;

And woods their scatter'd leaves supply3
And thrice the teil-worn rustics beet
The hated ecrth with glcdscme feet.

ΤΟ TELEPHUS.

, Fnon Inachus what lustres sped,

Till Codrus for his country bled,
With AEacus‘ majestic rece,
And sacied Ilicn's were, you hece.
