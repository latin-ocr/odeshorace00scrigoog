See where he wavee his oigny felohion high,

ἵ ’Midwiffingfoes,wh0sellfor1iberty!

As Auster hereseos th'e tomelees sees,

Χ When clouds ere oleft by deneing Pleiades,
So serried ranke the Romen warrior tiree,
Urging his forming steed ’mid hostile firee3
As rolle the Algidus its roering tide,

Whose wetere through Apulian Deunin ghide,
When raging, furious, to the expectant main,
He threatens deluge ho the well-till'd plain,
So Claudius rush'd upon the iron hande,

- The hostile armies from barbarian lende -- ¹
Renk efter rank mow’d down their firm arrey,
Himself unerath’d amid the ensanguin’d frey.

Thine were the troopS, the eounsel, and the Fates3

For on thet‘day‚ when Alexandrie's gnteS,

And course-deserted then -were open thrown,

·- 'Twes the third lustre- Portuno, all thine own,
