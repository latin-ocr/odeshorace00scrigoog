ons 1v. OF HORAGE.

What honor mayst thou not acquire

As semin-law to Phyllis’ sire?

For surely -sprung from royal veins —
Of unjust Lares she complains.

Think not that she-thy honest flame -

From vile plebeian pources came ;
Nor - known for saith and lucre's scorn -
' From low-brad mother mum be bom.

Her arms-her face -her tapering thigh,

Hem-whole, Ipraise3 - shun jealousy
Of one, whose years demand repose3
-Eight lustros, trembling to their close!
