ons m. ΟΕ· ΗΟΒΑΟΕ.

While fortune wills -years yet unsped —
And the three sisters’ sable thread.

Nor purchas'd grows, nor home thou’lt save,

· N or seat, by Tiber’s yellow wave;

And all the wealth you now possess,
- Pil'd up alost — the heir shall bless.

¹Though rich - from Inachus you come.

Though poor — of meanest birth in Rome,
Boasting no covering but the sky,
Unpitying Oreus bids thee die.

One common road we all must take ;

The urn ahke eaeh lot must shake ς

— Τὴθ fatal lot 1 -which soon or late,
Consigns us to our Stygiae fate.
