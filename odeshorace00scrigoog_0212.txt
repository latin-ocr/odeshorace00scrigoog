Ἴ om: v1. οἳ nomon. 193

Had Trojan's fated feast deceiv'd‚
Nor Priam’s dancing revels griev'd3

¹ But, impious !— to his captives dire -
Had boldly burn’d in Grecian fire
Poor speechless babes-their fiery tomb
The expiring mothers' burning womb;
Had not the sire of gods, beguil'd
When Phoebus pray’d‚ and Venus smil'd‚
Decreed AEneas’ walls to rise

With more auspicious auguries‘

Thou, parent of Thalia’s sweet note,
Lyrist, whose curls 011 Xanthus fioat,
Phoebus, AgyieuS, hastef-attend,

Τὴθ pride of Daunia's muse defend.
Genius to me from Phoebus came,

- The poet’s art -the poet’s name :

Ye noble mide, and boys whose rane
The blood of proudest sires may trace -
