om: x1v. OF HOBAGE.

In vain from crue] Mars we fiee,
And the hoarse waves of Adria’s θεας
In vain the injurious south we sear,

So baneful to the autumnal year ε

, All-all must to Cocytus go,
Durk wanderiug with its languid fl0w;
To Danaus’ raoe —w AEolus’ son,

Condemn’d to roll the eternal stone.

Lands ·- house-and wife, so form’d to please,
Must all be left ;—n0r of these trees

shall one attend their master brief,

- save the detested cypress·leaf ;

Thy Oaecuban‚ aworthier heir

shall quaff- of countless keys the care 3-
And dyo the floor with nobler wine
Thau deeks the feasts where pontiffs dine.
