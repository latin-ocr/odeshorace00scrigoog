ODE V.

TO AUGUSTUS.

Beer with auspicious gods! - best guard of Rome!
Long absent now -too long, ales l — from home,
Return 3- the sacred senate elaims thy v0w‚

- Thy treasur’d promise of return ere now. -

Great chief, te Rome thy bright refulgenee bring,

The brilliant aspect, - like the beams of spring -
Which-rhed 0’er Rome—illumes the cheerful day,

And bids the sun emit a elearer ray.

-As the fond mother seeke her youthful care,

With vom, and omens, end assiduous prayer,
Her bey—whom envious sorthern blasts detain

Beyond the waves of the Carpathian main,
