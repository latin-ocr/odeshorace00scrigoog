ons 1. OF ΗοΒΑοΕ. 109

The man—content with srugal storo-

’ Dreads not the billows' angry roar,

When fieree Arcturus sets in wrath,

Or Haedus mounts his fiery path:

Nor fears the vine-destroying hail, ’
Nor lest deceitful crops should fail ;

. Oareless if floods, or wintry breem,
Or drought invade his tendor trees.

Lords of the soil - in wealthy pride —
Enoroach upon the ocean tide,
Where structmes, rear'd by builders' slaveS,

Envy the fish their less'ning waves3

But coward sear and threats betray

Such haughty lords‚ where’er they stray;
Dark care about the galley glides,

And close behind the horseman rides.
