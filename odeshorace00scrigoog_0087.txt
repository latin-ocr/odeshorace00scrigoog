ODES

Awhilo the tragio Muse resign,

Let Olio's harp alone be thino;

Then -public thomos discuss'd -reolaim
Thy Attio work of buskin’d fame3

Thou solaco of defendants’ tonso,

Thou born to calm the senate's feam,

Pollio, on whose immortal brow

¹ Dalmatio’s laurel'd triumphs proudly glow.

Hark! how thy trumpots shake the shore !
Hark! hork! thy stunning olarions' roar!
See, how thy dozzflng 'arms affright

The fiying stood-the timorous knight3
Now mighty ohiofs my fancy hears,
Whom not inglorious dust besmears3

. All earth - submissive - owns control,
All, but unbending Cato’s stubborn soul.
