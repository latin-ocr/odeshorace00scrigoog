ODE VII.

TO POhlPElUS VARUS.

0111 oft with me to mortal hour

Redue'd, when Brutus led our power ;

Who heth restord thee to our eyes,

To Roman sanes and Roman skies,

Varus- my earliest friend - whose smile
Could still the lingering day beguile,

While Syn'an spikenard grao'd our hair,

And Bacchus ohas’d eaoh anxious aare ?
With thee I shar’d Philippi's field,

The flight, where - shame ! —I lost my shield 3
When conquer'd valour’s threat'ning brow
Το the base earth was humbled low ;

But me, through hostile troops — in dread —
Enwrapt in olouds - swift Hermes sped;
While thee the eddying tide once more,
With boiling wareo, to battle bore.
