ODES ³001 111. Ι

Lea neither piety nor power

Rebuild in Troy the ancestral tower3
Since Fortuna with repeated blow,

Shall lay the ill-omen’d hulwarks low3 ·
While 1- Jove’s sister and his wife-
Myself will lead the victor-strife3

Thriee should Apollo raiae the wall,
Thrice by my Greeks the bra-ss shall fall3
Thriee shall the wife, in captive chain,
Lament her lord— her children slain.''

These themes ill suit the joeund lyre 3-
Say‚ whither wouldst thou, Musa, ashire?
Ceaee - eauoy - godlike words tor sing,

Nor tune ta heaven thy earth-born stn‘ng.
