. ODES

To him let natione bend the knee‚

In justice like, though less than thee3
Whilst thou, in thine avenging ear,
Shalt shake Olympus from afar,

And hurl thy angry boh sublime

O'er sacred groves profan'd by crime.

ODE xm

TO LYDIA.

Whene'er of Telephus the ehurms,

The rosy neck -the waxen arms —

’ My Lydie’s umorous rapturee praise

The rising bile my ruge betrays ;

’ My senses reel—my eolor flies—
And furtive hears suffuee mine eyes ;
Proving how inwardly I glow,

Consum’d by turtures fieree -but elow.
