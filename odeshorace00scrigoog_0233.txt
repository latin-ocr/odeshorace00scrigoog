ODES soor rv:

No more lieentious flames are spread,
But discipline prevails instead ;
Crimes now no more our age disgraee,

But ancient arts ¹resume their plaee3

Those aits, by which the Latin neme,
Italie's strength - Itelia’s fame!

And Rome’s majestis rule inerees'd‚

To Hesper from the dawning Eest.

While Oaeser migne, nor civil stn'fe,
Nor warfere mers our peaeeful life ;

Nor rege, which forg’d the warrior's swerd,
And disoord en the natione pour'd.

They, who the Danube's margin prese,
The Julian lewe no more transgress -—
Nor Getae - Seres—faithless Perse-

Nor whom swift Teneis' wetere nurse.
