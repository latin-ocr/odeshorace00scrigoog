ODE XXX. s

-1 mvn rcis’d e proud structure, enduring cs brues,

And more lofty than Egypt’s pyrcmidel mass, ¹

Which nor rein, nor the impetent north cun 0’cr-
throw‚ l

Nor the passage of sessons-cs swiftly they flow.

Ι shall not all die ;-f0r apert cf me yel

Shnll escape the dark stream, thet compels to forget;

I perchcnce may increase, by the fame of my lays, · ²

-For ever renew'd in posterity's praise.

From the cepitcl's summit my neme shall extend, 4

While the priest and the virgin in silence ascend 3.

Renown'd where lond Aufidus leshes the shore,

And where shallow Daunus rul’d werricus of yore3 ³

Once humble-now proud the AEolicn rhyme

To heve set to the mensures of Itely’s clime.

Assume, then, sweet Muse, cll pride that is chine,

And my heir with the Delphicn laurel cutwine.
