Let me my father’s setters beer,

Because my hapless lord I spare3

Or let his fleet their captive place
Among the extreme Numidian race3

Go, where propitious galee invite,
Shielded by Venus, and the night ς

Ge —- blest - and with this tale of gloom
Inseribe thy memory‚ end my tomb.'’

ODE XII.

’το mmmmm

ΑΗ ῐ hapless maidens! - whom an unele’e brow
Ferbids the fond delights of love to know!
Forbids with wine te erown the love1³e joy! -
Thee, Neobule Cytheree’s boy,

Robs of thy loom - Minerve's busy art

N egleeted now for lovely Hebrue’ heart3
