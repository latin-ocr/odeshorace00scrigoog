130 onas 3001 m Ι

In vain : - unharm'd - each tale he mocks,

- More deaf than the Iearian rocks -
But thou to fond E'nipeus’ sighs

Aocord no neighbousss sympathie83

Though none, superlor, guidos the horse,
Nor shines‚ more brilliant, in the course3

Nor- when he breasts the Etrurian tides -
More swiftly through the water glides.

At night-fall close the door -nor peep,

When plaintive pipe assails th} sloep3
And still inflexible romain,

Howe'er of harshness he complain.
