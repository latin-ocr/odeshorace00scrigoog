ODE XV.

TO OHLORIS.

Oa pauper Ibicus the wife,

Quia-quit at length thy wauton life3
With less of infamy 'behava

- Mora fitted for the timely grave 1 -

Ceaae with young virgins to appear,
- A cloud upon the starry sphere ; -
Not what fair Pholo'e' may adom,

By thee, old Chloris, ean be worn.

Thy daughter at our doors may beat,
By timbrel roua'd to Thyan heat3
On Nothua -pasaionata -aha doats ;

- So lova, ao frisk the wanton goats.
