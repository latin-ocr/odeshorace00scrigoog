ODE H.

ΤΟ ANTONIUS IULUS.

Tfls bard, who would like Pindar sing,

Iulus, strives with waxen wing,
-Like Icarus, who fondly gave

His name to the cerulean wave.

As rush the swollen rivers down,

By mins beyond their boundaries grown,

So foams the deep-mouth'd Pindsr’s song,

So rushes- measureless - along:

Secure Apollo’s wreath to bear,
Or if, with new-eoin’d terms, he dare
The boldest dithyrambis verse,

And lewless numbers to rehearse3
